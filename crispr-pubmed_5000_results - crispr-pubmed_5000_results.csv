However, its specific role and potential mechanism to initiate cotton fibers remain unclear. This study employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to analyze DNA methylation alterations in ZM24 and ZM24 fuzzless-lintless (ZM24fl) during fiber initiation. Our results indicated that DNA 6mA methylation exhibited the most remarkable difference among ovule samples at -2, 0, and 5 d post anthesis of ZM24 and ZM24fl. Subsequently, genes with significant changes in DNA 6mA methylation and transcription during fiber initiation were screened. We found that GhMAF1 displayed significant transcriptional upregulation and 6mA enrichment in its promoter, which could serve as a potential target for DNA 6mA in fiber initiation. Further, we knocked out GhMAF1 using CRISPR-Cas technology and demonstrated that GhMAF1 specifically promotes the initiation of fiber cells at the base of the ovule by mediating the downstream JAZ2/CPC-MML3/MML4 pathway. These findings unveil a novel spatial module of fiber cell initiation on the ovule surface that involves GhMAF1. Ultimately, this work provides significant knowledge for the regulatory network of DNA 6mA modification in fiber initiation to improve fiber yield and quality.","6mA methylation, GhMAF1, cotton, fiber initiation, spatial differentiation"

Selective breeding and crossbreeding are the primary methods used for genetic improvement in modern agriculture. However, these methods face challenges due to long breeding cycles and the necessity for beneficial genetic variation associated with high-quality traits within the population. This limitation restricts the transfer of desirable alleles across different genera and species.

The study of mitochondrial biology is complicated by its own small genome, which is matrilineally inherited and not subject to recombination, and present in multiple, possibly different, copies. Recent methodological developments have enabled the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in large-scale cohorts and highlight the far-reaching impact of mitochondrial genetic variation. Genome-editing techniques have been adapted to target mtDNA, further propelling the functional analysis of mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria are finely tuned signalling hubs, a concept that has been expanded by advances in methodologies for studying the function of mitochondrial proteins and protein complexes. Mitochondrial respiratory complexes are of dual genetic origin, requiring close coordination between mitochondrial and nuclear gene-expression systems (transcription and translation) for proper assembly and function, and recent findings highlight the importance of the mitochondria in this bidirectional signalling.",N/A

40064355,Role of the Neuropeptide S receptor 1 rs324981 polymorphism in modulating emotionality and cognitive flexibility: insights from a gene-edited mouse model.,Behavioural brain research,2025,"Virginie Rappeneau, Ann-Marie Tobinski, Leonardo Miguel Caisachana Guevara, Neele Meyer, Kay Jüngling, Chadi Touma","The neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor (NPSR1) are involved in various physiological processes, including arousal, sleep, anxiety, memory, and stress responses in rodents. Recent attention has focused on the association between the NPS/NPSR1 system and stress-related disorders, particularly involving a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the NPSR1 gene (rs324981). This SNP causes an amino acid change at position 107 in the protein, reducing NPSR1 signalling potency; however, its effects on behavioural, cognitive, and physiological aspects relevant to stress-related disorders remain unclear. Addressing this topic, we characterized the behavioural phenotype of a gene-editing mouse model, expressing either the murine/ancestral NPSR1-I107 variant or the human NPSR1-N107 variant. Both, male and female mice underwent a comprehensive behavioural test battery assessing arousal, exploratory and anxiety-related behaviour under varying levels of novelty stress. Moreover, cognitive functions were evaluated with a special focus on cognitive flexibility using the Attentional Set Shifting Task (ASST). Additionally, markers of behavioural and endocrine stress reactivity were assessed as well as changes in body weight and body composition. Our results showed that NPSR1-N107 mice displayed increased anxiety-related behaviour compared to NPSR1-I107 mice, with no significant differences in arousal, exploratory behaviour or hormonal stress responses. However, NPSR1-N107 mice also exhibited better rule-reversal learning in the ASST, indicating enhanced cognitive flexibility. These findings provide clear evidence for a role of the NPSR1 rs324981 SNP in regulating emotionality and cognitive flexibility, underscoring the potential of the NPSR1-I107N mouse model for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying stress-related disorders.","Behavioural flexibility, Emotionality, Neuropeptide S, Neuropeptide S receptor 1, SNP, Stress response"
40063421,Wnt Inhibition Safeguards Porcine Embryonic Stem Cells From the Acquisition of Extraembryonic Endoderm Cell Fates.,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2025,"Hanning Wang, Liang Zhong, Zhuangfei Wang, Jinzhu Xiang, Duanqing Pei","Porcine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are excellent models for exploring embryogenesis, producing genetically enhanced farm animals, and improving breeding. Various chemicals have been applied to generate porcine ESCs from embryos, which differ from mouse and human ESC derivation. Wnt inhibitors XAV939 or IWR1 are required to isolate and maintain porcine ESCs. How Wnt inhibitors specify porcine ESC fate decisions remains poorly understood. Additionally, whether porcine ESCs can be converted to extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells without genetic interventions has not been reported. Here, it is reported that Wnt inhibitors (i.e., XAV939 and IWR1) safeguard porcine ESCs from acquiring the XEN lineage. Porcine ESCs rely on Wnt inhibitors to maintain pluripotency. Without them, porcine ESCs exit from pluripotency and convert to XEN cells. An efficient strategy and culture conditions are further developed to directly derive porcine XEN cells from ESCs without gene editing. The resulting XEN cells from ESCs exhibit similar transcriptome and chromatin accessibility features to XEN cells from embryos and contribute to mouse extraembryonic tissues. This study will deepen the understanding of porcine pluripotency, lay the foundation for deriving high-quality porcine ESCs with germline chimerism and transmission, and provide valuable materials to study extraembryonic development and lineage segregation in livestock.","ESCs, Wnt inhibition, XEN cells, pig, pluripotency"

Sensitivity to HS differs based on the species and developmental stage of the plant, making it challenging to define HS and its impacts. Efforts to enhance HS tolerance by traditional breeding are constrained by limited genetic resources, but understanding the mechanisms that regulate HS responses can enable efforts to improve heat tolerance by precision breeding and gene editing. Here, we review recent research on the effects of HS on major cereal crops at different developmental stages and identify key genes potentially involved in the HS response, offering insight for precision molecular breeding. Additionally, we discuss the use of favorable natural variants and gene editing to improve crop tolerance to HS, emphasizing the value of alleles involved in thermomemory, combined stress tolerance, and the stress response-growth balance. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in understanding HS responses in crops, highlighting potential avenues for generating heat-tolerant crops.","Crops, Heat stress, High temperature, Thermotolerance, Thermotolerance breeding"

While the emergence of hiPSC-CMs solved the inadequacy of cardiomyocytes in cardiovascular research, they frequently remain immature: more closely resembling fetal rather than adult cardiomyocytes. This immaturity limits their functional utility in both laboratorial and clinical practices. Early methods focused on optimizing culture media with hormones and growth factors to regulate gene transcription related to structural proteins and metabolic enzymes. Subsequently, mechanical training platforms such as static and cyclic stretching were developed to enhance sarcomere alignment and protein expression. Electrical pacing has also been implemented as a crucial method to improve electrophysiological properties by synchronizing contractions and enhancing ion channel expression. The integration of these techniques, along with gene editing and co-culture systems, has significantly advanced the maturation process of hiPSC-CMs. Our review comprehensively explores the advancements in mechanical and electrical stimulation techniques for promoting the maturation of hiPSC-CMs and provides valuable insights for developing effective maturation protocols.","Cardiomyocyte maturation, Cardiovascular disease, Electrical pacing, Human-induced pluripotent stem cells, Mechanical stimulation, Tissue engineering"
40059830,AAV-mediated base editing restores cochlear gap junction in GJB2 dominant-negative mutation-associated syndromic hearing loss model.,JCI insight,2025,"Takao Ukaji, Daisuke Arai, Harumi Tsutsumi, Ryoya Nakagawa, Fumihiko Matsumoto, Katsuhisa Ikeda, Osamu Nureki, Kazusaku Kamiya","Mutations in the gap junction β2 (GJB2) gene, which encodes connexin 26, are the leading cause of genetic deafness. These mutations are characterized by the degeneration and fragmentation of gap junctions and gap junction plaques (GJPs) composed of connexin 26. Dominant-negative mutations of GJB2, such as R75W, cause syndromic hearing loss and palmoplantar keratoderma. We previously reported that the R75W mutation, a single-base substitution where C is replaced by T, causes fragmentation of GJPs. Therefore, an adenine base editor (ABE), which enables A-to-G base conversions, can potentially be useful for the treatment of this genetic disease. Here, we report that an all-in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, which includes a compact ABE (SaCas9-NNG-ABE8e) with broad targeting range, and a sgRNA targeting the R75W mutation in GJB2 corrected this pathogenic mutation and facilitated the recovery of the gap junction intercellular communication network of GJPs. In a transgenic mouse model with the GJB2 R75W mutation, AAV-mediated base editing also restored the fragmented GJPs to orderly outlines in cochlear supporting cells. Our findings suggest that an ABE-based base-editing strategy could be an optimal treatment for the dominant form of GJB2-related hearing loss, GJB2-related skin diseases, and other deafness-related mutations, especially single-base substitutions.","Gene therapy, Genetics, Therapeutics"

However, adverse outcomes primarily due to histocompatibility differences between the donor and the patient are still of concern. Progress in genetic and molecular mechanisms, as well as new technology to insert DNA sequences in cell genomes has allowed the development of strategies to treat genetic diseases by correcting the gene defect in patients' cells. This technology is named gene therapy. Gene therapy approaches being developed for IEI are mediated by gene insertion, using a retroviral vector, or by gene editing, using a combination of a nuclease and a DNA template. After the unexpected occurrence of oncogenesis associated with the initial retroviral vector designs, significant advances have led to successful gene therapy clinical trials for three forms of SCID, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach. Active preclinical and clinical studies are ongoing for diverse IEI, including chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, severe congenital neutropenia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked agammaglobulinemia and familial forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.","CGD, IEI, SCID, WAS, gene editing, gene therapy, immunodeficiency, retroviral vector"

40057930,Enhancing wheat resilience: biotechnological advances in combating heat stress and environmental challenges.,Plant molecular biology,2025,"Muhammad Arif, Muhammad Haroon, Ayesha Fazal Nawaz, Hina Abbas, Ruhong Xu, Luhua Li","Climate change, with its increasing temperatures, is significantly disrupting global agricultural systems, and wheat, a key cereal crop faces severe challenges. Heat stress has emerged as a critical threat, accelerating wheat growth, leading to premature maturation, reduced grain filling, and ultimately lower yields. The situation is exacerbated by more frequent and intense heat waves, particularly in regions already struggling with water scarcity. Maintaining the delicate balance of temperature and water necessary for optimal wheat production is becoming challenging, posing a serious risk to global food security. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop adaptive strategies with innovations in breeding and transgenic technologies crucial to improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses, especially to combat the growing impacts of heat stress. Modern tools like CRISPR/Cas9, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, and Zinc Finger Nucleases have been instrumental in developing wheat varieties with improved traits. However, the future of wheat cultivation requires more than just resistance to a single stressor. As climate change intensifies, there is an urgent need for wheat varieties that can withstand multiple stresses, including heat, drought, and pests. Developing these multi-stress-tolerant cultivars is crucial for ensuring food security in a rapidly changing climate.","CRISPR/Cas9, Climate change, Global food security, Heat stress, Wheat"

Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are critical to studying tumorigenesis and tumor-immune interactions, which may inform new treatment approaches. However, current midline glioma GEMM approaches are limited in their ability to multiplex perturbations and/or target specific cell lineages in the brain for genetic manipulation. Here, we combined the RCAS/tv-a avian retrovirus system and CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to drive midline glioma formation in mice. CRISPR/Cas9-based disruption of Trp53, a tumor suppressor that is frequently disrupted in midline gliomas, along with the oncogene PDGF-B resulted in high grade tumor formation with moderate latency (median time to tumor formation of 12 weeks). We confirmed CRISPR-mediated Trp53 disruption using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Next, we disrupted multiple midline glioma tumor suppressor genes (Trp53, Pten, Atm, Cdkn2a) in individual mouse brains. These mini-pooled in vivo experiments generated primary midline gliomas with decreased tumor latency (median time to tumor formation of 3.6 weeks, P < 0.0001, log-rank test compared to single-plex gRNA). Quantification of gRNA barcodes and CRISPR editing events revealed that all tumors contained cells with various disruptions of all target genes and suggested a multiclonal origin for the tumors as well as stronger selection for Trp53 disruption compared to disruption of the other genes. This mouse modeling approach will streamline midline glioma research and enable complex experiments to understand tumor evolution and therapeutics.","CRISPR, Cre/loxP, Diffuse midline glioma, Genetic mouse model, Midline glioma, Retrovirus"

An atom-modification-based strategy is reported to enhance the cleavage activity of TtAgo, improving its practicability in TtAgo-based nucleic acid testing. Specifically, the 2'-fluorine (2'F)-modified guide DNA (2'F-gDNA) shows significant enhancement in the cleavage activity of TtAgo on double-stranded (dsDNA) by increasing the melting temperature (Tm) and strengthening the binding affinity between 2'F-gDNA and the targeted dsDNA. These findings are considered important for both molecular diagnostics and gene editing. A careful review of the article, however, raises questions that merit further discussion. After comprehensively reviewing the cleavage mechanism and structure of TtAgo-gDNA-target ternary complexes, and thoroughly analyzing our results, it is believed that the increased Tm and binding affinity of 2'F-gDNA are not the primary factors that enhance cleavage activity, it is speculated that the 2'F modification at gDNA 3'-end likely influences the propagation step. The data suggest that several details need to be addressed to improve the robustness of 2'F-gDNA/TtAgo cleavage.","2'‐fluorine modified gDNA, TtAgo, dsDNA cleavage, gene editing, nucleic acid detection"

NF2-SWN represents a difficult management problem with most patients facing substantial morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Gene therapy involves replacing a faulty gene or adding a new gene in an attempt to cure disease or improve the patient's condition. Several studies of gene therapy for NF2-SWN have utilized adeno-associated viral vector serotype-1 (AAV1) to deliver apoptosis-inducing enzyme, the pore-forming protein gasdermin-D, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, and functional merlin causing schwannoma regression in a xenograft mouse model. These studies support the potential therapeutic efficacy of gene therapy against NF2-SWN. Currently, gene therapy approaches primarily include bystander-killing effect by inducing immune responses, gene replacement or augmentation therapy, and gene knockdown and replacement combination approach through genome-editing technology. Although these gene therapeutic strategies have shown potential in preclinical animal model studies, they still face many specific challenges apart from the traditional challenges in gene therapy, such as immunogenicity, delivery vector, manufacturing, and long-term effects of treatments.

However, the longstanding problem of weed infestation in the fields is a major constraint that significantly hampers the productivity of pigeonpea. Glyphosate, a widely used post-emergent, broad-spectrum, systemic herbicide, has emerged as an effective weed management strategy at the field level. It inhibits the chloroplastic enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) in the shikimate pathway by competitively inhibiting its substrate, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), thus curtailing the biosynthesis of essential aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan). This makes glyphosate lethal to weeds and the main crop as well. To address this susceptibility towards glyphosate, we developed glyphosate-resistant pigeonpea plants by modifying the PEP-binding site within the native CcEPSPS enzyme at positions 182G-to-A, 183T-to-I, and 187P-to-S, for reducing glyphosate binding affinity.

An amphiphilic SP acts as a photothermal converter, and its backbone is grafted with single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which enables hybridization with single guide ribonucleic acid (sgRNA) via complementary base pairing to form sgRNA/SP-DNA. This sgRNA/SP-DNA nanosystem (nanoCRISPR) can effectively deliver sgRNA into cells and generate heat under NIR laser irradiation via the photothermal effect. The localized heat triggers the dissociation of single-stranded DNA and sgRNA to control the release of sgRNA, thereby achieving precise regulation of CRISPR activity.

A compact plant type reduces shading between plants, especially at high planting density, but also creates a humid microenvironment often associated with a higher incidence of pathogen and pest attacks, especially under highly humid climates. However, how to precisely manipulate the tiller angle to achieve a desirable plant type has been under-approached. Here we report the creation of gradient tiller angles in indica rice by fine tuning the expression of TILLER ANGLE CONTROL1 (TAC1), a domesticated gene in cultivated rice. We edited the regions upstream and downstream of the TAC1 coding sequence using multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 technology and developed homozygous allelic lines carrying deletions/inversions of various sizes at different positions. Those lines displayed smooth gradient changes in tiller angle that aligned well with TAC1 expression levels. Additionally, changes in the TAC1 expression level had no impact on other agronomic traits examined. TAC1 is well conserved across species, including perennial fruit trees in which mutation of TAC1 orthologs leads to a broomy plant type. Thus, our results provide a guide to creating tiller angles for selection according to climate zones in rice breeding programs, this approach can be extended to diverse species for improving plant architecture.","TAC1, genome editing, plant architecture, rice, tiller angle"

In this study, it is found that an increase in the methylation level of the CpG sequence on the newly generated strand can increase PE efficiency and that de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3A/3B) are involved in the PE repair pathway. On the basis of these novel findings, the development of an episomal element-driven PE system (epiPE) achieved through the use of EBNA1/oriP are presented, which increases methylation levels around target sites and prolongs PE expression. A comparative analysis with canonical PE systems, including PE2, lentiPE2, and PE4max, reveals that the epiPE2 system significantly enhances editing efficiency while maintaining minimal insertion and deletion (indels) rates. Specifically, comparing to PE2, the epiPE2 system demonstrated an efficiency enhancement of 2.0 to 38.2-fold. In addition, the epiPE2 system is capable of efficient multiplex precise gene editing at up to 10 genetic loci in human cells. In conclusion, this findings increase the understanding of the PE repair mechanism, and presents the epiPE2 system as an efficient and multiplex-capable prime editing tool with potential applications in both basic research and translational studies.","EBNA1/oriP, gene editing, methylation, multiplex, prime editor"

Significant progress has been made in developing genetic resources, including the recently completed reference genome of the sugarcane cultivar R570 and pan-genomic resources from sorghum, a closely related diploid species. Biotechnological approaches including RNA interference (RNAi), overexpression of transgenes, and gene editing technologies offer promising avenues for accelerating sugarcane improvement. These methods have successfully targeted genes involved in important traits such as sucrose accumulation, lignin biosynthesis, biomass oil accumulation, and stress response. One of the main transformation methods-biolistic gene transfer or Agrobacterium-mediated transformation-coupled with efficient tissue culture protocols, is typically used for implementing these biotechnology approaches. Emerging technologies show promise for overcoming current limitations. The use of morphogenic genes can help address genotype constraints and improve transformation efficiency.

Nonetheless, the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in fruit ripening remains unclear. Here, we identified lncRNA1471 as a negative regulator of tomato fruit-ripening initiation. Knocking out lncRNA1471 via large fragment deletion resulted in accelerated initiation of fruit ripening, a shorter color-breaking stage (BR), deeper coloration, increased levels of ethylene, lycopene, and β-carotene, accelerated chlorophyll degradation, and reduced fruit firmness. These phenotypic changes were accompanied by alterations in the carotenoid pathway flux, ethylene biosynthesis, and cell wall metabolism, primarily mediated by the direct regulation of key genes involved in these processes. For example, in the CR-lncRNA1471 mutant, lycopene-related SlPSY1 and SlZISO were upregulated. Additionally, the expression levels of ethylene biosynthetic genes (SlACS2 and SlACS4), ripening-related genes (RIN, NOR, CNR, and SlDML2), and cell wall metabolism genes (SlPL, SlPG2a, SlEXP1, SlPMEI-like, and SlBG4) were significantly upregulated, which further strengthening the findings mentioned above. Furthermore, lncRNA1471 was identified to interact with the abscisic stress-ripening protein (ASR) transcription factor by chromatin isolation by RNA purification coupled with mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) and protein pull-down assay in vitro, which might regulate key genes involved in tomato ripening. The discovery of the significant non-coding regulator lncRNA1471 enhances our understanding of the complex regulatory landscape governing fruit ripening.

It is involved in two phases of wound healing, i.e. initial closing layer formation and subsequent wound periderm development. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of wounded potato leaf tissue revealed preferential induction of cell wall modifying processes during closing layer formation, accompanied by a highly active defense response. To address the importance of suberin in this process, we generated loss of function mutants by CRISPR-Cas9 editing the suberin transporter gene StABCG1. Both wound-induced StABCG1 transcript levels and suberin formation around wounded leaf tissue were reduced in CRISPR-lines. Moreover, wound-induced tissue damage was characterized by browning of wound-adjacent areas. Transcriptome analyses of these areas revealed up-regulation of genes encoding defense proteins and enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Levels of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, acting in defense and in cell wall reinforcement, were drastically enhanced in CRISPR compared to control plants. These results suggest that the reduction in suberin formation around wounded tissue leads to a loss of barrier function, resulting in tissue browning due to enhanced exposure to oxygen.","Solanum tuberosum, Hydroxycinnamic acid amides, Potato, Suberin, Wound healing"

By using LC16m8, a replicating virus homologous to the target virus, as a helper virus for the bacterial artificial chromosome system, we successfully recovered genome-edited infectious viruses. Oncolytic viruses with limited growth in normal cells were obtained by deleting the genes for vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF), extracellular signal-regulated kinase-activating protein (O1L), and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) present in the viral genome. Furthermore, the amino acid residues of seven proteins involved in extracellular enveloped virus virion formation were replaced to the IHD-J strain sequence, which is known to highly express extracellular enveloped virus. In cultured cancer cells (HeLa), these modified viruses showed cytotoxicity and increased productivity, but it was confirmed that the cytotoxicity was suppressed in normal cells (normal human dermal fibroblasts). For in vivo safety evaluation, a modified virus (MD-RVV-ΔRR-EEV6) in which the VGF, O1L, and RNR genes of LC16m8 were deleted and the genes of six extracellular enveloped virus-associated proteins were replaced with sequences derived from IHD-J strain, and another modified virus (MD-RVV) lacking only the VGF and O1L were administered intravenously to severe combined immunodeficiency mice.

The CRISPR-Cas9 technique is based on the type II CRISPR system of bacteria and involves the Cas9 nuclease, which is targeted to a particular genome section with the help of single-guide RNA. Initially used for random mutations and small sequence alterations, genome editing methods have advanced to achieve large-scale DNA segment manipulation. The BE and PE-- type CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing variants provide new therapeutic options for genetic disorders, improving patients' prognosis. Curative gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to correct HBB gene mutations that cause SCD represents a revolutionary therapeutic development. These advances bring new hope to patients with previously untreatable diseases, potentially offering a future where genetic disorders can be addressed at their roots. A major objective of CRISPR technology is to enhance its precision and speed, both critical for effective gene editing. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, CRISPR-- Cas9-based approaches for HBB gene modification, clinical trials, patients with sickle cell disease, and advances in CRISPR technology for sickle cell disease.","BE, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, DNA., PE, Sickle cell disease, beta globin, clinical trials, patents"

Despite its clinical significance, effective treatments remain challenging due to a limited understanding of its pathogenic mechanism. This study developed a genetic manipulation system in Acanthamoeba to facilitate gene function and drug screening studies. We applied the Cre/loxP system to integrate the gene encoding the tdTomato fluorescent protein into the genome of Acanthamoeba castellanii via homologous recombination. The polyubiquitin gene and its untranslated regions were identified and verified, after which the tdTomato gene was cloned between the untranslated regions of the polyubiquitin gene. The construct was then introduced into the Acanthamoeba genome using a modified pLPBLP vector containing loxP sites. Cre recombinase was utilized to remove the neomycin resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites, and genetically modified cells were selected by clonal dilution. The integration of the tdTomato gene, confirmed through PCR and fluorescence microscopy, showed stable expression in both trophozoites and cysts without the need for antibiotic selection. We demonstrated the feasibility of antibiotic-free reporter gene expression in Acanthamoeba. The system provides a valuable tool for functional genomics, allowing us to explore gene functions in Acanthamoeba and develop reliable drug screening models. Furthermore, the ability to express genes without the continuous use of selection markers opens up new possibilities for studying the pathobiology of this pathogen and advancing the development of novel therapeutic strategies against Acanthamoeba infections.","Acanthamoeba, Cre/loxP system, drug screening system, genetic manipulation, homologous recombination, tdTomato"

However, detecting the resulting mutations by analysis of sequencing data remains time-consuming and inefficient. In response to this issue, we designed SuperDecode, an integrated software toolkit for analyzing editing outcomes using a range of sequencing strategies. SuperDecode comprises three modules, DSDecodeMS, HiDecode, and LaDecode, each designed to automatically decode mutations from Sanger, high-throughput short-read (next-generation sequencing), and long-read sequencing data (third-generation sequencing), respectively, from targeted PCR amplicons. By leveraging specific strategies for constructing sequencing libraries of pooled multiple amplicons, HiDecode and LaDecode facilitate large-scale identification of mutations induced by single or multiplex target-site editing in a cost-effective manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of SuperDecode by analyzing mutations produced using different genome editing tools (CRISPR/Cas, base editing, prime editing) in different materials (diploid and tetraploid rice, protoplasts), underscoring its versatility in decoding genome editing outcomes across different applications. Furthermore, this toolkit can be used to analyze other genetic variations, as exemplified by its ability to estimate the C-to-U editing rate of the cellular RNA of a mitochondrial gene. SuperDecode offers both a standalone software package and a web-based version, ensuring its easy access and broad compatibility across diverse computer systems. Thus, SuperDecode provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing a wide array of mutations, advancing the utility of genome editing for scientific research and genetic engineering.","CRISPR/Cas, SuperDecode, genome editing, high-throughput, mutation analysis, sequencing"

However, insufficient liver resources and immune rejection after transplantation, as well as a shortage of liver tissue or cell donors, are challenges faced in clinical treatment.

Previously, we generated transgenic rice plants with altered lignin aromatic composition and enhanced biomass utilization properties by suppressing the expression of p-COUMAROYL ESTER 3-HYDROXYLASE (C3'H). While RNAi-derived C3'H-knockdown lines displayed relatively normal growth with substantially augmented levels of p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignin units, genome-edited C3'H-knockout lines exhibited severely impaired growth phenotype, leading to arrested seedling development. In this study, we further characterized the genome-edited C3'H-knockout rice by analyzing gene expression and phenolic metabolite profiles alongside phenotypic traits and cell wall lignin structure. The seedlings of the C3'H-knockout rice displayed irregular vasculature and ectopic lignification. RNA-sequencing analysis detected widespread changes in the expression of genes associated with plant growth, hormone biosynthesis and signaling, and stress responses in the C3'H-knockout rice. Overall, our data suggested that C3'H disruption activates metabolic sensor-mediated signaling pathways, which in turn regulate phenylpropanoid metabolism. In line with this, phenolic metabolite profiling of the C3'H-knockout rice revealed not only shifts in monolignol-associated phenylpropanoids but also reductions in flavonoids and salicylic acid derivatives. Moreover, changes in the aromatic composition of the mutant lignin and phenolic metabolites indicated the presence of parallel monolignol pathways enabling rice to produce guaiacyl- and syringyl-type monolignol derivatives in the absence of C3'H activity.

However, depending on the environmental conditions, additional ATP may be required to fix CO2, which can be generated by cyclic electron transfer (CET). How the balance between LET and CET is determined remains largely unknown. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) may act as the switch between LET and CET, channelling photosynthetic electrons to LET when it is bound to photosystem I (PSI) or to CET when it is bound to cytochrome b6f. The essential role of FNR in LET precludes the use of a direct gene knock-out to test this hypothesis. Nevertheless, we circumvented this problem using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9)-mediated gene editing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Through this approach, we created a chimeric form of FNR tethered to PSI via PSAF. Chimeric FNR mutants exhibited impaired photosynthetic growth and LET along with enhanced PSI acceptor side limitation relative to the wild type due to slower NADPH reduction.

Here we compared two delivery strategies, electroporation and enveloped delivery vehicles (EDVs), to investigate the Cas9 dosage requirements for genome editing. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we determined that >1300 Cas9 RNPs per nucleus are typically required for productive genome editing. EDV-mediated editing was >30-fold more efficient than electroporation, and editing occurs at least 2-fold faster for EDV delivery at comparable total Cas9 RNP doses. We hypothesize that differences in efficacy between these methods result in part from the increased duration of RNP nuclear residence resulting from EDV delivery.

Previously, we demonstrated that knock-out mutants of the Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1) gene can significantly enhance rice resistance to sheath blight (ShB), and we mapped DEP1's association with panicle length. In this study, we discovered that dep1 mutants significantly reduced rice yield. Nonetheless, truncated DEP1 was able to achieve both ShB resistance and yield increase in japonica rice. To further explore the function of truncated DEP1 in promoting yield and ShB resistance, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing mutants, including a full-length deletion mutant of DEP1, named dep1, and a truncated version, dep1-cys. Upon inoculation with Rhizoctonia solani, the dep1-cys mutant demonstrated stronger ShB resistance than the dep1 mutant. Additionally, dep1-cys increased yield per plant, whereas dep1 reduced it. Compared to the full DEP1 protein, the truncated DEP1 (dep1-cys) demonstrated a decreased interaction affinity with IDD14 and increased affinity with IDD10, which are known to positively and negatively regulate ShB resistance through the activation of PIN1a and ETR2, respectively. The dep1-cys mutant exhibited higher PIN1a and lower ETR2 expression than wild-type plants, suggesting that dep1-cys modulated IDD14 and IDD10 interactions to regulate PIN1a and ETR2, thereby enhancing ShB resistance. Overall, these data indicate that precise genome editing of DEP1 could simultaneously improve both ShB resistance and yield, effectively mitigating trade-off regulation in rice.","DEP1, genome editing, resistance, rice, sheath blight, yield"

Nucleic acids,2025,"Auroni Deep, Anjali Bhat, Vivekanandan Perumal, Saran Kumar","i-Motifs, cytosine-tetrads, or C-quadruplexes are intercalated structures formed by base pairing between cytosine and protonated cytosine. These structures demonstrate increased stability in acidic environments due to the presence of the latter cytosinium group (i.e., the protonated cytosine). Research has shown that i-motifs are typically disrupted or destabilized at physiological pH levels (7.0-7.4), which makes their potential formation in the nucleus and their biological relevance uncertain. However, in 2018, it was demonstrated that i-motifs exist within the nucleus under physiological conditions, with various intracellular factors contributing to their stability. Identification of i-motifs in the nucleus and their association with gene promoters-particularly with those of proto-oncogenes-has generated significant interest in their potential regulatory functions. Additionally, recent studies suggest that i-motifs may function as switches for gene expression, influencing gene regulation through their folding and stabilization or unfolding and destabilization.

PERC uses a single amphiphilic peptide reagent to mediate intracellular delivery of the same pre-formed CRISPR ribonucleoprotein enzymes that are broadly used in research and therapeutics, resulting in high-efficiency editing of stimulated immune cells and cultured hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). PERC facilitates nuclease-mediated gene knockout, precise transgene knock-in and base editing. The protocol involves mixing the CRISPR ribonucleoprotein enzyme with peptide and then incubating with cultured cells. For efficient transgene knock-in, adeno-associated virus (AAV) homology-directed repair template (HDRT) DNA may be included. In contrast to electroporation, PERC is appealing because it needs no dedicated hardware and has less impact on cell phenotype and viability. Because of the gentle nature of PERC, delivery can be performed multiple times without substantial impact to cell health or phenotype. Editing efficiencies can surpass 90% when using either Cas9 or Cas12a in primary T cells or HSPCs. After 3 h dedicated to reagent preparation, the PERC delivery step can be completed in 1 h, with the associated cell culture steps taking 3-7 d total. Because the protocol calls for only three readily available reagents (protein, RNA and peptide) and does not require dedicated hardware for any step, PERC demands no special expertise and is exceptionally straightforward to adopt.

Additionally, lentiviral delivery requires high biosafety levels. To address this challenge, we have developed a two-step strategy that supports CRISPR-Cas9 through lentivirus and murine ecotropic γ-retrovirus.

Phryma leptostachya is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb renowned for its applications in both conventional medicine and natural botanical insecticides, with lignans as the main active ingredients. During the biosynthesis of lignans, PlCYP81Q38, a P450 protein, is assumed to play a crucial role and is accountable for the production of sesamin from (+)-pinoresinol. As a cutting-edge genome editing tool, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely employed across diverse species for gene functional research but yet to be harnessed in P. leptostachya. This study utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system in conjunction with hairy root transformation to initiate targeted mutagenesis in PlCYP81Q38 gene. Employing binary vectors, pYLCRISPR/Cas9Pubi-H, complemented by dual single-stranded guided RNAs (sgRNAs), enabled precise editing at two gene sites and the deletion of large fragments. This editing system resulted in mutagenesis rates surpassing 79%, achieving a notable rate of 61.9% fragment deletion mutants. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the impact on lignan biosynthesis by PlCYP81Q38-targeted mutagenesis, resulting in the accumulation of pinoresinol and disrupted production of sesamin, 6-demethoxy-leptostachyol acetate, and leptostachyol acetate. Furthermore, the knockout of PlCYP81Q38 up-regulated its upstream pathway genes, such as dirigent gene, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase genes, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase genes, and p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase genes, identified through gene co-expression analysis. Collectively, mediated by the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, the new biotechnology for targeted genome editing within P. leptostachya, our findings affirm the significant roles of PlCYP81Q38 in the lignan biosynthesis pathway and highlight the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in exploring the functional genome and secondary metabolite biosynthesis of this plant species.","Phryma leptostachya, PlCYP81Q38, CRISPR/Cas9, Hairy roots, Lignan biosynthesis, Target mutagenesis"

Evidence indicates that CFTR loss-of-function, in addition to promoting a pro-inflammatory phenotype, is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, suggesting that CFTR can exert tumor-suppressor functions. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro culture models, such as the CF lung airway-on-a-chip, can be suitable for studying PMN recruitment, as well as events of cancerogenesis, that is epithelial cell invasion and migration, in CF. To gather insight into the pathobiology of CFTR loss-of-function, we generated CFTR-knockout (KO) clones of the 16HBE14o- human bronchial cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and performed a comparative proteomic analysis of these clones with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Systematic signaling pathway analysis of CFTR-KO clones revealed modulation of inflammation, PMN recruitment, epithelial cell migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Using a latest-generation organ-on-a-chip microfluidic platform, we confirmed that CFTR-KO enhanced PMN recruitment and epithelial cell invasion of the endothelial layer. Thus, a dysfunctional CFTR affects multiple pathways in the airway epithelium that ultimately contribute to sustained inflammation and cancerogenesis in CF.","CRISPR/Cas9, cystic fibrosis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, organ‐on‐a‐chip, proteomics"

Both syndromes are predominantly characterized by the development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors, which typically arise from cranial/peripheral nerves. The management of NF1/SWN-associated benign nerve sheath tumors pose a substantial clinical challenge. In recent years, immunotherapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating various tumors, but its application to NF1/SWN has not been explored. In this study, we first evaluated the feasibility of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for the treatment of benign NF1/SWN-related nerve sheath tumor by analyzing the expression of multiple antigens in 85 tumor samples. Our findings revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) was highly expressed in most samples, indicating its potential as an ideal target for CAR-T cell therapy. Additionally, TGFβ1 and PDL1, key inhibitory regulators of T cell function within solid tumor microenvironment (TME), were universally overexpressed in these samples, highlighting the immunosuppressive nature of NF1/SWN tumors. To target HER1, we constructed CARs using three distinct scFvs (806, E2 and NEC). All three types of CAR-T cells demonstrated significant tumor-eliminating capability against NF1/SWN tumor cell lines, with 806 CAR-T cells showing the highest efficacy.

We studied the function of tomato HOOKLESS2 (SlHLS2), a member of the GCN5 family of HATs, through genetic, molecular and genomic approaches. Tomato hls2 mutants generated through CRISPR-cas9 gene editing show enhanced susceptibility to fungal infection, accelerated dark-induced senescence, grossly altered plant architecture, and loss of fertility accompanied by high levels of auxin accumulation. Components of the basal and induced transcriptome underlying the extensive phenotypic impact of HLS2 were uncovered. HLS2-dependent differentially expressed genes were enriched for genes implicated in photosynthesis, protein ubiquitination, oxylipin biosynthesis, autophagy, and response to biotic stimuli. In particular, induced expressions of the BTB/POZ and TAZ domain-containing protein gene (SlBT1), AUTOPHAGY-RELATED PROTEIN 11, ACYLSUGAR ACYLTRANSFERASE 3 (ASAT3), and multiple jasmonate biosynthesis genes require functional HLS2. SlHLS2 associates with the SlBT1 promoter, and histone acetylation at the chromatin of SlBT1 was reduced in the Slhls2 mutant suggesting direct regulation of SlBTB1 by HLS2. SlBTB1 is an adapter of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (CUL3-RBX1-BTB), which mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of proteins. HLS2 is degraded after fungal inoculation, which is stabilized by inhibition of the 26S proteasome.

In sickle cell disease (SCD) a single mutation in the β-globin (HBB) gene results in dysfunctional hemoglobin protein, while in β-thalassemia, over 300 mutations distributed across the gene reduce β-globin levels and cause severe anemia. Genetic engineering replacing the whole HBB gene through homology directed repair (HDR) is an ideal strategy to restore a benign genotype and rescue HBB expression for most genotypes. However, this is technically challenging because 1) the insert must not be homologous to the endogenous gene and 2) synonymous codon-optimized, intron-less sequences may not reconstitute adequate β-globin levels. Here, we developed an HBB gene replacement strategy using CRISPR-Cas9 that successfully addresses these challenges. We determined that a DNA donor containing a diverged HBB coding sequence and heterologous introns to avoid sequence homology provides proper physiological expression. We identified a DNA donor that uses truncated γ-globin introns, results in 34% HDR, rescues β-globin expression in in vitro models of SCD and β-thalassemia in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).

The natural-evolution-like giant SpCas9 (GS-Cas9) is created and shows substantially improved editing precision. We further discover that enlarging the REC domain could enable regulation of the N-terminal adenine deaminase TadA8e tethered to the Cas9 scaffold, which contributes to substantially reducing unexpected editing and improving the precision of the adenine base editor ABE8e.

While its seed oil offers valuable dietary benefits due to a balanced ratio of human essential fatty acids, the traditional high oil-yielding varieties contain an elevated level of erucic acid (EA, C22:1) associated with adverse health effects. Therefore, developing low erucic acid (LEA) mustard cultivars is crucial for broader utilization and consumer safety. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool was employed to disrupt the fatty acid elongase1 (FAE1) gene that encodes a key enzyme in EA biosynthesis in two high erucic acid (HEA) B. juncea cultivars, PCR7 (∼39% EA) and JD6 (∼45% EA). Targeted knockout (KO) of BjFAE1 homeoalleles (BjFAE1.1 and BjFAE1.2) in this amphidiploid plant species using CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, each carrying two guide RNAs led to generation of single (either fae1.1 or fae1.2) and double (fae1.1fae1.2) mutants. Best performing homozygous fae1.1fae1.2 KO lines showed a near-complete elimination of EA in both the cultivars (<0.5% in PCR7, undetectable in JD6) with a marked increase in nutritionally beneficial oleic acid (from ∼18% to ∼32% in PCR7, from ∼9% to ∼38% in JD6). Moreover, the content of essential fatty acids also increased substantially [linoleic acid (C18:2) 1.9-fold in PCR7 and 2.1-fold in JD6; linolenic acid (C18:3) 2.5-fold in PCR7 and 1.4-fold in JD6], suggesting rerouting of carbon flux from EA biosynthesis. Importantly, these LEA lines retained key agronomic traits like plant seed yield and oil content, matching the productivity of the unedited control elite cultivars. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for editing B. juncea genome, developing plant lines producing LEA seed oil with improved nutritional quality and broadening the utility of this important oilseed crop for food and non-food applications.","BjFAE1, CRISPR/Cas9, High erucic acid, Indian mustard, Transgenic lines, low erucic acid"

Additionally, lncRNAs mediate chromatin remodeling and enhancer‑promoter long‑range chromatin interactions to control oncogene expression by recruiting chromatin organization‑associated proteins, thereby promoting carcinogenesis. Furthermore, lncRNAs aberrantly induce oncogene expression by mediating epitranscriptomic modifications, including RNA methylation and RNA editing.

Here, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to knockout HvGS3 in barley. The height of hvgs3 plants were reduced by 37.8 ~ 43.1% compared to wild type, and the culm lodging resistance index (CLRI) of the second internode of stems was increased by 76.6%. The decrease in cell length of the second internode was similar to its node length. The shorter cells may be the main reason for the declines in the internode length and plant height. The number and area of vascular bundles, the epidermal thickness, and the mechanical tissue thickness were significantly higher in hvgs3 due to the higher lignin content. Transcriptome analysis showed higher expression of structural genes related to lignin biosynthesis. Gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis was suppressed through the down-regulation of the GA3ox gene, and the application of gibberellin restored the plant height of hvgs3, indicating that plant height was altered by hindering gibberellin biosynthesis.

Here, we introduce a gene delivery system utilizing an intrinsically disordered protein of α-synuclein (αS) demonstrated to interact with lipid membranes by transforming its original random structure to an α-helix. Since the helix bundle formation is a signature of cell-penetrating peptides for membrane translocation, a multitude of αS(Y136C)s replacing tyrosine at the C-terminus with cysteine were covalently attached onto gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in a specific orientation with the helix-forming basic N-termini exposed outward.

RhoB, a member of the Rho GTPase family, plays a major role in prostate cancer metastasis by modulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. It is crucial in regulating cytoskeletal reassembly, cell migration, focal adhesion (FA) dynamics. To investigate RhoB's function in prostate cancer, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique was utilized to knock out the RhoB gene in prostate cancer cells. Successful gene editing was confirmed by using T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assays and Sanger sequencing. Knocking out RhoB enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased the IC50 value of docetaxel in RhoB-knockout PC-3 cells. This suggests increased sensitivity to docetaxel. Furthermore, RhoB knockout prompted the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, effects that were reversed upon RhoB overexpression. Interestingly, RhoB status did not significantly influence the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells. RNA sequencing of PC-3 cells with either overexpressed or knock-out RhoB revealed that RhoB regulates pathways involved in FA, ECM receptor interaction, and PI3K-AKT signaling. These pathways directly influence the EMT process, cell migration, and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Notably, RhoB overexpression activated PI3K-AKT signaling when PC-3 cells were treated with low concentration of DTXL (50 nM, 72 h). This activation reduced DTXL's cytotoxicity, suggesting may confer chemoresistance via PI3K-AKT pathway activation.","CRISPR/Cas9, Docetaxel, Prostate cancer, RNA-Seq, RhoB"

We confirm that U1-driven crRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm, while conventional U6 promoter-driven crRNAs are mostly confined to the nucleus. Furthermore, we reveal that the end positions of crRNAs expressed by the U1 promoter are consistent regardless of guide sequences and lengths. We also demonstrate that U1-driven crRNAs, but not U6-driven crRNAs, can efficiently repress the translation of target genes in combination with catalytically inactive Cas13 proteins.

Nonetheless, the intrinsic mechanisms that govern microglial activation in the aftermath of IS remain incompletely elucidated. ADAR1 p150 plays a significant role in immune regulation and stress responses; however, the specific pathways through which it modulates microglial activation and the subsequent mechanisms that unfold following IS have yet to be clearly delineated. The distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) mouse model was utilized to induce IS. The evaluation of infarct volume was conducted through TTC staining, while neurological function was assessed using the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). To evaluate the expression of ADAR1 and apoptosis-related proteins, immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques were employed. BV2 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R). Additionally, a co-culture system of BV2 cells and neurons was established, and subsequent assessments of neuronal viability and apoptosis were performed using CCK-8 assays and LDH release assays. ADAR1 p150 expression was significantly upregulated in the brains of ischemic mice, particularly within microglial cells. The overexpression of ADAR1 p150 was found to promote microglial activation and enhance pro-inflammatory responses, whereas the knockdown of ADAR1 p150 yielded the opposite effect. Additionally, the knockdown of ADAR1 p150 in microglia resulted in a marked reduction in neuronal apoptosis within the co-culture system. Rescue experiments indicated that the knockdown of NUPR1 partially reinstated the inflammatory response previously induced by ADAR1 p150 knockdown. Notably, ADAR1 p150 knockdown also inhibited A-to-I RNA editing while simultaneously upregulating NUPR1. Furthermore, the reduction of ADAR1 expression was associated with decreased infarct volume, improved neurological outcomes, and a significant attenuation of neuroinflammation in dMCAO mice. ADAR1 p150 enhances the microglial inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis in IS by facilitating A to I RNA editing of NUPR1.","ADAR1, Ischemic stroke, Microglia, Neuroinflammation, Neuron apoptosis"

Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an economically important fruit crop that has been cultivated for thousands of years. Fruit color, a crucial trait influencing the appearance quality and economic value of melons, is primarily determined mainly by the type and concentration of pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, and flavonoids. Identifying the genetic loci that govern melon fruit color contributes to breeding efforts aimed at enhancing melon rind coloration. This study reports an EMS-induced mutant, designated as gf1 (golden fruit 1), which produces fruit with both golden peel and flesh. Through MutMap and map-based cloning, we localized the gf1 locus to an 862 kb region containing 42 SNPs. Of these, a single SNP in the coding region caused a stop-gained mutation in the gene Cme13C08g017690, which exhibits the highest sequence similarity to Arabidopsis ETHYLENE-DEPENDENT GRAVITROPISM-DEFICIENT AND YELLOW-GREEN 1 (EGY1).

TLRs play a crucial role in delaying barrier repair, promoting Th2-mediated dermatitis, shifting the response toward Th1 in the chronic phase, and contributing to the establishment of the itch-scratch cycle, as well as mediating the effects of UV radiation. The dysregulation of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of TLRs can be attributed to their ligand structures, receptor heterodimerization, the relative frequency of each TLR, interactions with other receptors/signalling pathways, cytokine milieu, and genetic polymorphisms. Current AD treatments like vitamin-D analogs, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine partially work through TLR modulation. Direct TLR stimulation using different compounds has shown therapeutic benefits in preclinical studies. However, significant challenges exist, including off-target effects due to ubiquitous TLR expression and complex roles in immune responses. Future directions include CRISPR-based gene editing to understand TLR functions, development of specific TLR modulators for targeted therapy, and machine learning applications to predict drug responses and identify novel ligands.

However, in living organisms, several pharmacokinetic challenges arise, including off-target side effects due to incorrect distribution, low bioavailability caused by membrane impermeability, and instability resulting from enzymatic degradation. Therefore, innovative delivery strategies must be developed to address these issues. Modified nanoparticles offer a potential solution for the non-invasive delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs).

These endogenous materials can facilitate receptor-mediated endocytosis or transcytosis. Nanoparticles encapsulating Cas9 RNPs and coated with ligands targeting such receptors may be internalized through receptor-mediated mechanisms. Once internalized, Cas9 RNPs could perform the desired gene editing in the nucleus after escaping the endosome through mechanisms such as the proton sponge effect or membrane fusion.

Allogeneic CAR T-cell approaches may overcome these challenges but require further engineering to reduce their alloreactivity. As a means to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of allogeneic CAR T-cells, we have selected a micro RNA (miRNA)-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting CD3ζ which efficiently downregulates the expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR) below detection level.

Young leaves of ylc exhibited a yellow base and green tip, with reduced chlorophyll content, and altered chlorophyll fluorescence pattern, and underdeveloped grana in chloroplasts. The color of mutant leaves gradually transitioned to pale green and then became green in mature leaves. The ylc phenotype was found to be controlled by a recessive locus mapped to a 2.4 Mb interval on chromosome 7HS using bulked-segregant analysis with deep sequencing and further fine mapped to a 410 kb interval using polymorphic markers. The YLC locus co-segregated with a molecular marker that led to identification of HORVU7Hr1G011570 as the most likely candidate gene.

Epitope tags enable immuno-based studies of genes for which no antibodies are available. These alleles enable detailed and precise developmental, mechanistic, and translational research. The first step in generating these alleles is to identify within the target sequence-the orthologous sequence for base changes or the N or C terminus for epitope tags-appropriate Cas9 protospacer sequences. Subsequent steps include design and acquisition of a single-stranded oligonucleotide repair template, synthesis of a single guide RNA (sgRNA), collection of zygotes, and microinjection or electroporation of zygotes with Cas9 mRNA or protein, sgRNA, and repair template followed by screening born mice for the presence of the desired sequence change.

During spermiogenesis in haploid male germ cells, chromatin undergoes significant condensation, a phase in which most histones are replaced by a species-specific ratio of these two protamines. Altered PRM1/PRM2 ratios are associated with subfertility and infertility in both male mice and men. Notably, during histone-to-protamine exchange a small fraction of histones remains (ranging from 1% to 15%) bound to DNA. The regulatory roles of these residual histones, governed by post-translational modifications (PTMs), play a pivotal role in spermatogenesis, particularly in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation of genes during sperm differentiation or even in early embryogenesis. In this study, utilizing a Prm2-deficient mouse model and conducting an analysis of sperm samples from men exhibiting either normozoospermia or atypical spermiograms, we observed alterations in the methylation and acetylation profiles of histones H3 and H4. Subsequent in- depth analysis revealed that discrepancies in protamine ratios do not significantly influence the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones in testicular sperm. In murine epididymal sperm, altered protamine ratios are associated with reduced acetylation of histone H4 (H4ac), a phenomenon similarly observed in ejaculated sperm from men. In particular, H4K5ac and H4K12ac were identified as the two modifications that appear to decrease as a result of reduced Prm2/PRM2 levels. Our findings reveal that Protamine 2 is necessary for the maintenance of specific histone PTMs, such as acetylation, which is essential for proper spermatogenesis and particularly for chromatin remodeling.","Epigenetics, H4ac, Post-translational modifications, Protamine 2 (Prm2), Protamine ratio, male fertility, mouse model, spermiogenesis"

The objective of these advances is to achieve either a sterilizing or a functional cure, whereby the virus is either eradicated or controlled without the need for ongoing treatment. Gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have demonstrated the potential to remove HIV DNA from cells. LRAs, on the other hand, aim to reactivate latent virus, thereby rendering it susceptible to treatment or immune clearance. Immunotherapy, including therapeutic vaccines and broadly neutralizing antibodies, aims to enhance the immune response to HIV. However, achieving long-term suppression without antiretroviral therapy remains a significant challenge. Stem cell transplants have resulted in instances of remission; however, the methodology is intricate, perilous, and viable solely for patients with particular medical requirements.

They establish and maintain DNA methylation of the CpG island of promoter and non-CpG region of the genome. The abnormal methylation status of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) has been associated with tumorigenesis, leading to genomic instability, improper gene silence, and immune evasion. DNMT1 helps preserve methylation patterns during DNA replication, whereas the DNMT3 family is responsible for de novo methylation, creating new methylation patterns. Altered DNA methylation significantly supports tumor growth by changing gene expression patterns. FDA-approved DNMT inhibitors reverse hypermethylation-induced gene repression and improve therapeutic outcomes for cancer. Recent studies indicate that combining DNMT inhibitors with chemotherapies and immunotherapies can have synergistic effects, especially in aggressive metastatic tumors. Improving the treatment schedules, increasing isoform specificity, reducing toxicity, and utilizing genome-wide analyses of CRISPR-based editing to create personalized epigenetic therapies tailored to individual patient needs are promising strategies for enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

The apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele is the most prominent genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, dramatically increasing disease susceptibility and accelerating onset compared to its isoforms ApoE2 and ApoE3. ApoE4's unique structure, which arises from single-amino-acid changes, profoundly alters its function. This review examines the critical interplay between ApoE4 and microglia-the brain's resident immune cells-and how this relationship contributes to AD pathology. We explore the molecular mechanisms by which ApoE4 modulates microglial activity, promoting a pro-inflammatory state, impairing phagocytic function, and disrupting lipid metabolism. These changes diminish microglia's ability to clear amyloid-beta peptides, exacerbating neuroinflammation and leading to neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction. Additionally, ApoE4 adversely affects other glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, further compromising neuronal support and myelination. Understanding the ApoE4-microglia axis provides valuable insights into AD progression and reveals potential therapeutic targets. We discuss current strategies to modulate ApoE4 function using small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and gene editing technologies. Immunotherapies targeting amyloid-beta and ApoE4, along with neuroprotective approaches to enhance neuronal survival, are also examined. Future directions highlight the importance of personalized medicine based on individual ApoE genotypes, early biomarker identification for risk assessment, and investigating ApoE4's role in other neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the intricate connection between ApoE4 and microglial dysfunction, highlighting the necessity of targeting this pathway to develop effective interventions.

Advances in understanding plant-pathogen interactions have revealed the intricate roles of resistance (R) and susceptibility (S) genes in determining plant immunity. While R genes provide targeted pathogen resistance, they are often vulnerable to pathogen evolution. Conversely, S genes offer a promising avenue for developing broad-spectrum and durable resistance through targeted gene editing. Recent breakthroughs in CRISPR/Cas-based technologies have revolutionized the manipulation of plant genomes, enabling precise modification of S genes to enhance disease resistance in tomato without compromising growth or quality. However, the utilization of the full potential of this technique is challenging due to the complex plant-pathogen interactions and current technological limitations. This review highlights key advances in using gene editing tools to dissect and engineer tomato S genes for improved immunity. We discuss how S genes influence pathogen entry, immune suppression, and nutrient acquisition, and how their targeted editing has conferred resistance to bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens.

The precise modulation of performance has emerged as a significant challenge in advancing CRISPR technology to the next stage of development. Herein, we reported a CRISPR/Cas12a regulation strategy based on an overhanging activator. The presence of overhanging domains in activators creates steric hindrances that have a substantial impact on the trans-cleavage activity and activation timing of Cas12a. The trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a can be finely tuned by adjusting the position, length, and complementarity of the overhanging domains. Moreover, specific structures exhibit characteristics of automatic delayed activation. The presence of overhanging domains enables precise and timely activation of Cas12a, facilitating multifunctional applications.

In parasitic plants, the reliance on host-derived nutrients and loss of photosynthesis in holoparasites have led to highly degraded to absent plastid genomes, but its impact on mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) evolution has remained controversial. By examining mitogenomes from 45 Orobanchaceae species including three independent transitions to holoparasitism and key evolutionary intermediates, we identified measurable and predictable genetic alterations in genomic shuffling, RNA editing, and intracellular (IGT) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) en route to a nonphotosynthetic lifestyle. In-depth comparative analyses revealed DNA recombination and repair processes, especially RNA-mediated retroprocessing, as significant drivers for genome structure evolution. In particular, we identified a novel RNA-mediated IGT and HGT mechanism, which has not been demonstrated in cross-species and inter-organelle transfers. Based on this, we propose a generalized dosage effect mechanism to explain the biased transferability of plastid DNA to mitochondria across green plants, especially in heterotrophic lineages like parasites and mycoheterotrophs. Evolutionary rates scaled with these genomic changes, but the direction and strength of selection varied substantially among genes and clades, resulting in high contingency in mitochondrial genome evolution. Finally, we describe a universal roadmap for mitochondrial evolution in heterotrophic plants where increased recombination and repair activities, rather than relaxed selection alone, lead to differentiated genome structure compared to free-living species.","MTPT, RNA editing, horizontal gene transfer, intracellular gene transfer, operon, recombination, relaxed selection, repeats, retroprocessing"

CHD3, which is a causative gene of Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome (SNIBCPS), is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family related to chromatin remodeling. SNIBCPS is characterized by developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), macrocephaly, and facial features including a prominent forehead and hypertelorism. Hypersociability/overfriendliness is a notable behavioral feature in patients. Here, we describe five SNIBCPS patients with CHD3 variants from four families, including a sibling pair caused by parental gonosomal mosaicism. We observed two distinct phenotypes in our patients in accordance with previous observations. Phenotype 1: macrocephaly, hypertelorism, overgrowth, DD, and ID; and Phenotype 2: microcephaly, growth retardation, DD, and ID. Phenotype 1 was consistent with the typical SNIBCPS phenotype, while Phenotype 2 was distinct. To understand further the features of the patients with SNIBCPS, we generated chd3-knockout (KO) zebrafish using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. No morphological changes were observed in chd3-KO zebrafish. However, behavioral tests showed that chd3-KO zebrafish had strong and sustained interest in others, and were less aggressive toward others, suggesting a recapitulation of the hypersociability/overfriendliness phenotype in patients with SNIBCPS. Metabolomic analysis using whole brains showed changes in metabolites processed by specific mitochondrial enzymes in chd3-KO zebrafish. The administration of metformin, which reportedly ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities, attenuated the abnormal behavior of chd3-KO zebrafish. Our study helps delineate the phenotypes of patients with SNIBCPS, provides insights into a characteristic behavior of the disease, and suggests a potential treatment to improve the behavioral symptoms of patients.",N/A

These therapies can be programmed to target or restore defective genes, allowing for more personalised treatments and reducing side effects. Notably, RNA therapies have made significant progress in the treatment of genetic liver diseases, exemplified by small interfering RNA treatments for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, which use liver-targeting strategies such as GalNAc conjugation to improve efficacy and safety. RNA-based gene-editing technologies, such as base editor and prime editor clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats systems, also show promise with their ability to minimise genomic rearrangements and cancer risk. While RNA therapies offer high precision, challenges remain in optimising delivery methods and ensuring long-term safety and efficacy. Lipid nanoparticle-mRNA therapeutics, particularly for protein replacement in rare diseases, have gained support from preclinical successes. Compared with viral gene therapies, mRNA therapies present a safer profile with reduced risks of genomic integration and oncogene activation. However, clinical trials, especially for rare diseases, face limitations such as small sample sizes and short observation periods. Further preclinical studies, including non-human primates, will be essential for refining trial designs. Despite their potential, the high costs of RNA therapies pose a challenge that will require cost-utility models to guide pricing and accessibility.

This review explores the significant advancements and potential uses of CRISPR-Cas technology in the study and management of fish diseases, which pose serious challenges to aquaculture and wild fish populations. Fish diseases cause significant economic losses and environmental impacts, therefore effective disease control a top priority. The review highlights the pivotal role of CRISPR-Cas in identifying disease-associated genes, which is critical to comprehending the genetic causes of disease susceptibility and resistance. Some studies have reported key genetic factors that influence disease outcomes, using targeted gene knockouts and modifications to pave the way for the development of disease-resistant fish strains. The creation of such genetically engineered fish holds great promise for enhancing aquaculture sustainability by reducing the reliance on antibiotics and other conventional disease control measures. In addition, CRISPR-Cas has facilitated in-depth studies of pathogen-host interactions, offering new insights into the mechanisms by which pathogens infect and proliferate within their hosts. By manipulating both host and pathogen genes, this technology provides a powerful tool for uncovering the molecular underpinnings of these interactions, leading to the development of more effective treatment strategies. While CRISPR-Cas has shown great promise in fish research, its application remains limited to a few species, primarily model organisms and some freshwater fish. In addition, challenges such as off-target effects, ecological risks, and ethical concerns regarding the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment must be carefully addressed. This review also discusses these challenges and emphasizes the need for robust regulatory frameworks and ongoing research to mitigate risks. Looking forward, the integration of CRISPR-Cas with other emerging technologies, such as multi-omics approaches, promises to further advance our understanding and management of fish diseases. This review concludes by envisioning the future directions of CRISPR-Cas applications in fish health, underscoring its potential to its growing in the field.","Disease management, Genetic modification, Genetic resistance, Genome editing, Pathogen-host interactions"

We present a platform ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC method with UV and charged aerosol detection (CAD) to simultaneously separate and quantify lipid and nucleic acid components in LNPs. The method separated and quantified 12 lipid species and three types of nucleic acids (antisense oligonucleotide, single-guide RNA, and mRNA), covering a broad range of therapeutic cargoes. Notably, this can be achieved for the first time by one HPLC run with one-step facile sample preparation. Specifically, we used a simple buffer containing Triton and heparin to enable the single-step, simultaneous extraction of both nucleic acid and lipid components from LNPs, achieving quantification recoveries of 90-110 %. We further applied this method and addressed process and quality control challenges of LNPs, including the recovery rate of individual LNP components after purification and simultaneous quantification of co-loaded, different nucleic acid species for potential gene editing applications.

Recognizing the intricate regulatory networks of endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs), we posited that integrating specific miRNA target sequences into the 3' UTR of a gene could construct artificial miRNA-dependent regulatory circuits, facilitating precise spatiotemporal gene suppression. To test this hypothesis, we selected three endogenous miRNAs with unique expression profiles by analyzing rice miRNA expression profiles. Results from both transient assays and stable edited rice plants confirmed that in-locus incorporation of miRNA targets into the 3' UTR of target genes substantially reduced their expression in a spatiotemporal manner. Specifically, taking GID1 as the target gene, we found that knock-in of miR156a target led to a remarkable 97% constitutive reduction; knock-in of tissue-specifically expressed miR396c target significantly diminished its expression in shoots alone; and knock-in of the long-day induced miR528 target triggered a dramatic and temporal decrease by 95% specifically under such light exposure.

In breast cancer, disrupted regulation of TE sequences may facilitate tumor-specific transcriptomic alterations. We examine 142,514 full-length isoforms derived from long-read RNA sequencing (LR-seq) of 30 breast samples to investigate the effects of TEs on the breast cancer transcriptome. Approximately half of these isoforms contain TE sequences, and these contribute to half of the novel annotated splice junctions. We quantify splicing of these LR-seq derived isoforms in 1,135 breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1,329 healthy tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and find 300 TE-overlapping tumor-specific splicing events. Some splicing events are enriched in specific breast cancer subtypes - for example, a TE-driven transcription start site upstream of ERBB2 in HER2 + tumors, and several TE-mediated splicing events are associated with patient survival and poor prognosis. The full-length sequences we capture with LR-seq reveal thousands of isoforms with signatures of RNA editing, including a novel isoform belonging to RHOA; a gene previously implicated in tumor progression. We utilize our full-length isoforms to discover polymorphic TE insertions that alter splicing and validate one of these events in breast cancer cell lines. Together, our results demonstrate the widespread effects of dysregulated TEs on breast cancer transcriptomes and highlight the advantages of long-read isoform sequencing for understanding TE biology.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely acknowledged as a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic diseases such as obesity and obesity-associated MAFLD. Mitochondria are dynamic cellular organelles capable of modifying their functions and structures to accommodate the metabolic demands of cells. In the context of MAFLD, the excess production of reactive oxygen species induces oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which subsequently promotes metabolic disorders, fat accumulation, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in liver and adipose tissue. This review aims to systematically analyze the role of mitochondria-targeted therapies in MAFLD, evaluate current therapeutic strategies, and explore future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Viruses use host factors to replicate and move from cell to cell. Therefore, the editing of genes encoding viral host factors that are not essential for plant survival enables the rapid development of plants with durable virus resistance. Eukaryotic initiation factors, such as eIF4E and eIF4G, function as host factors for viral infection, and loss-of-function mutations of these factors lead to virus resistance. Broadening the spectrum of host factor targets would help expand resources for engineering virus resistance. In this study, we tested whether editing the eukaryotic translation elongation factor gene eEF1Bγ would produce virus-resistant plants. Accordingly, we targeted the four eEF1Bγ genes in Nicotiana benthamiana for editing using virus-induced gene editing (VIGE) with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV). Although we attempted to obtain plants edited for all four eEF1Bγ homologs, we failed to identify such plants. Instead, we obtained plants with three of the four homologs knocked out, harboring 1-bp insertion/deletions resulting in premature stop codons. These eEF1Bγ-edited plants did not exhibit resistance to Potato virus X (PVX), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), or Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) but showed reduced accumulation of Tobacco etch virus (TEV) compared to wild-type plants.

HIF-1α regulates critical pathways, including the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and immune checkpoint upregulation, leading to tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte dysfunction and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These alterations reduce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. Recent studies highlight therapeutic strategies that target HIF-1α, such as the use of pharmacological inhibitors, gene editing techniques, and hypoxia-modulating treatments, which show promise in enhancing responses to immunotherapy.

This modification enables T/NK cells to selectively eliminate tumor cells following adoptive transfer. One common approach to stably integrate CARs into the genome of T/NK cells is through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. However, these vectors mediate semi-random gene integration, posing risks such as oncogenic mutations, gene silencing, and variable CAR expression levels. Targeted integration of CAR genes into the specific genomic locus could overcome these limitations, but identifying the optimal integration sites to maximize the safety and efficacy of CAR-T/NK cell products remains a critical question. Improper integration sites may disturb the endogenous genes surrounding the integration sites, raising safety concerns. Additionally, regulatory elements at the integration sites, such as promoters, can influence the expression level of CAR genes, thus affecting the efficacy of CAR-T/NK cells. In this review, we summarized current strategies for selecting integration sites and promoters in the engineering of CAR-T/NK cells to achieve potent anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical studies.","CAR-NK, CAR-T, gene editing, promoter, site-specific integration"

Here, we targeted intra-articular (IA) tissues, including cartilage in the rat knee joint. In order to accurately deliver the DNA solution to the joint cavity, the Actranza prototype attaching a 30G needle as a guide was used (30G-Acranza). The injection powers are controllable adjusting the amounts of ignition powder (IP) and smokeless powder (SP). Preliminary tests determined an optimal injection site (5 mm depth from the skin surface into the anterior joint cavity with the knee flexed) and injection volume (30 µL). Initial trials with 30G-Actranza-25/40 (IP/SP = 25 mg/40 mg) showed luciferase plasmid (pLuc) expression levels (relative luminescence units, RLU) that were approximately 40 times higher than manual syringe injections 24 h after the administration. Additional Green Fluorescent Protein plasmid (pGFP) experiments detected fluorescence in chondrocytes and cruciate ligament fibroblasts. The higher-powered 30G-Actranza-35/40 further increased pLuc expression compared to syringe injections (∼ 100 times). The expression remained detectable 10 days post-injection, though reduced from day one. Speed-controlled tests indicated that pLuc expression levels increased with injection speed, reaching saturation at 693 µL/s of 30G-Actranza-35/40.

Building on the principle that type III CRISPR complex determines target cleavage positions based on gRNA length in 6-nt increments, we hypothesized that engineering gRNAs with bulge loops could circumvent this rule, allowing for flexible RNA excision. Through systematic evaluation of gRNAs with various bulge loops, we established the rules for precise non-6-nt target cleavage and repair. We observed that the complex tolerates 1- or 2-nt bulge loops and accommodates large bulge loops ranging from 6 to 24 nt. Consequently, SCISSOR could accomplish nearly any length of short fragment excision. With its capability to modify open reading frames, we demonstrate the potential of SCISSOR in repairing frameshift mutations and introducing frameshifts to create immunogenic poly-epitopes in human cells.

Subsequently, a genome-editing tool was established in MG1655 by using TnpB (as a thermophilic programmable endonuclease), achieving up to 100% editing efficiency, while IscB/enIscB achieved editing in ATCC9637/BL21(DE3). Additionally, the editing plasmids were successfully cured. Finally, the mechanism underlying the escape of E. coli during TnpB/IscB editing was elucidated.

39971832,Dwarfs standing tall: breeding towards the 'Yellow revolution' through insights into plant height regulation.,Plant molecular biology,2025,"Shankar K Bhujbal, Archana N Rai, Archana Joshi-Saha","High oilseed production is an exigency due to the increasing edible oil consumption of the growing population. Rapeseed and mustard are cultivated worldwide and contribute significantly to the world's total oilseed production. Already a plateau is reached in terms of area and yield in most of the existing cultivars. Most of the commercially cultivated high yielding rapeseed and mustard varieties are tall, mainly due to a wider use of heterosis. However, they are susceptible to lodging and consequent yield losses. Plant yield is strongly dependent upon its architecture; therefore, 'ideotype breeding' is the key approach adopted to develop new varieties with enhanced yield potential, which is less explored in these crops. Dwarf/ semi dwarf plant type varieties has shown its improved yield potential over tall plant type in cereals which further leads to 'Green revolution' in Asian countries. Although, many induced dwarf mutants in rapeseed and mustard were isolated, unlike dwarf green-revolution varieties of cereals, most of them had undesirable plant types with defects including extreme dwarfism and sterility, leading to poor yield potential. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing plant height and its correlation with yield and yield contributing characters is crucial. In this review, recent insights into genetic, molecular, and anatomical regulation of plant height have been discussed. The role of hormones, their crosstalk, and hormonal control for cell division and expansion have been delineated with respect to plant architecture. Many dwarfing genes are identified as being part of various phytohormone pathways. Parallelly, molecular links between plant height and flowering time have been explored. The overall synthesis of the review points out some key target pathways and genes that will be useful for plant breeders as well as biotechnologists for targeted genome editing for improving plant architecture without a yield penalty.","Brassica, Cell cycle, Lodging, Phyto-hormones crosstalk, Plant height, Yellow revolution"

However, the utility of CRISPR/Cas12a, a particularly promising gene-editing tool, is constrained by its temperature sensitivity, limiting its application in low-temperature environments. In this study, we developed a gene-editing technique based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system in the poikilothermic species goldfish Carassius auratus. We systematically evaluated the editing efficiencies of LbCas12a and AsCas12a on the tyrosinase (tyr) gene under varying temperature conditions. Our results revealed a pronounced temperature dependence of Cas12a, with elevated temperatures markedly enhancing its editing activity, particularly for AsCas12a. A brief one-hour high-temperature treatment was sufficient to achieve effective gene disruption, underscoring CRISPR/Cas12a as a rapid and efficient gene-editing tool. Temperature was utilized as a conditional trigger for Cas12a-mediated gene knockout, enabling precise modulation of gene disruption at specific embryonic developmental stages. Whole-genome resequencing of the mutants confirmed the absence of off-target effects, further emphasizing the precision of this editing process. These findings indicated that CRISPR/Cas12a represented a viable alternative to the widely utilized CRISPR/Cas9 system and could be applied in conjunction, thereby expanding the potential applications of gene-editing technologies.","CIRSPR/Cas12a, Carassius auratus, Temperature"

In this study, a novel endo-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, Endo CM, was characterized in the mushroom-forming fungus Cordyceps militaris, where it plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the fungal cell wall. Through gene editing, the Endo CM promoter was engineered to remove the binding site of the CmCreA carbon catabolite repressor, and the transformant was named CmT. After 12 h of treatment with simulated digestive fluids, the residual mycelial biomass of CmT was reduced to 50.00 ± 1.57 %, compared with 69.47 ± 0.97 % (p = 0.00005) for the parent strain. CmT also released more amino acids during the simulated digestion, suggesting that the expression level of Endo CM affects the accessibility of mycelial biomass to digestive enzymes. Additionally, CmT produced fruiting bodies with improved flavor but impaired appearance. This study highlights the production of alternative proteins with high digestibility and provides a sustainable approach for breeding mushrooms with improved digestibility and absorption properties.","CRISPR/Cas9, Cordyceps militaris, Endo-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, Molecular design breeding, Mycoprotein"

PHTS is characterized by an elevated lifetime risk of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), 30 times higher than the general population. However, only 1 in 3 PHTS patients develop DTC, and it remains unknown whether specific PTEN variants are associated with an increased risk of DTC. PTEN antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway, a frequently affected pathway in sporadic DTC. PTEN also acts as a guardian of the genome by interacting with other tumor suppressors. Here, we report how ionizing radiation, an environmental tumorigenic contributor, modifies the DNA damage response based on the type of germline PTEN variants. We hypothesized that certain PTEN variants associated with DTC create a pro-oncogenic molecular signature upon radiation-induced DNA damage. DTC-associated (PTEN M134R ) or DTC-non-associated (PTEN G132D ) germline PTEN mutant alleles were introduced into a human induced pluripotent cell (hiPSC) line derived from a healthy donor utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. We determined radiation-induced transcriptomic changes in functional thyroid organoids induced from wild-type and both heterozygous PTEN mutant hiPSCs. Both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that radiation upregulated the p53 network more potently in the thyroid organoids with PTEN WT/G132D than those with PTEN WT/M134R , which could be mediated by AKT-dependent MDM2 inactivation and PTEN-p53 physical interaction. Our data suggest that the lack of p53 pathway activation through PTEN-p53 network interactions explains why PTEN M134R is a DTC-susceptible variant.","DNA damage, PTEN, oncogenesis, p53, thyroid organoid"

The high homology of apo(a) with plasminogen initially leads us to think of Lp(a) as a player in the coagulation system as pro-thrombotic factor. Over the years, a solid body of evidence from biology, epidemiology and from genetics and mendelian randomization has contributed to identify Lp(a) as a causal factor of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, aortic calcific valve stenosis and ischaemic stroke. The active involvement of Lp(a) in atherogenesis and aortic calcific valve stenosis has been demonstrated by experimental data regarding the role of oxidized phospholipids, which are the cargo of Lp(a) and the presence of a Lp(a) receptor in valve interstitial cells. In secondary prevention, patients optimally treated for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but with high Lp(a) levels show a residual cardiovascular risk.

These cells have potential applications in human and animal health and livestock production. Somatic cell nuclear transfer or cloning is currently being used to produce genetically edited animals. A highly differentiated genome is the main obstacle to correcting epigenetic reprogramming by enucleated oocytes during cloning. Activation of pluripotency genes in the somatic genome is a promising strategy to contribute to more efficient epigenetic reprogramming, improving this technique. Recently, epigenome editing has emerged as a new generation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 technology with the aim of modifying the cellular epigenome to turn genes on or off without modifying DNA. Here, we characterize the DNA methylation profile of the CpG island spanning the 5' untranslated region to intron 1 of the bovine octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct4) gene in gametes, embryos, and fibroblasts. DNA methylation patterns were categorized into three levels: low (0%-20%), moderate (21%-50%), and high (51%-100%). Sperm and embryos showed a hypomethylation pattern, whereas oocytes exhibited a hypo- to moderate methylation pattern. Fetal and adult skin fibroblasts were hypomethylated and moderately methylated, respectively. These results are essential for future studies aimed at manipulating the expression of Oct4. Thus, epigenome editing can be used to turn on the Oct4 in somatic cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells.

39952682,Alternative Splicing Dynamics in Plant Adaptive Responses to Stress.,Annual review of plant biology,2025,"Abdulrahman Alhabsi, Yu Ling, Martin Crespi, Anireddy S N Reddy, Magdy Mahfouz","Plants thrive in dynamic environments by activating sophisticated molecular networks that fine-tune their responses to stress. A key component of these networks is gene regulation at multiple levels, including precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing, which shapes the transcriptome and proteome landscapes. Through the precise action of the spliceosome complex, noncoding introns are removed and coding exons are joined to produce spliced RNA transcripts. While constitutive splicing always generates the same messenger RNA (mRNA), alternative splicing (AS) produces multiple mRNA isoforms from a single pre-mRNA, enriching proteome diversity. Remarkably, 80% of multiexon genes in plants generate multiple isoforms, underscoring the importance of AS in shaping plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Recent advances in CRISPR-Cas genome and transcriptome editing technologies offer revolutionary tools to dissect AS regulation at molecular levels, unveiling the functional significance of specific isoforms. In this review, we explore the intricate mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing and AS in plants, with a focus on stress responses. Additionally, we examine how leveraging AS insights can unlock new opportunities to engineer stress-resilient crops, paving the way for sustainable agriculture in the face of global environmental challenges.",N/A

Infections by this pathogen result in serious mortality of seedlings due to root and root collar disease, and growth reduction in trees due to canker formation and dieback. Although much is known about the population biology, genetics, and genomics of F. circinatum, relatively little is known regarding the molecular basis of pathogenicity in F. circinatum. In this study, a protoplast-based transformation using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing was utilized to functionally characterize a putative pathogenicity gene in three different strains of the fungus. In silico analyses suggested the gene likely encodes a small secreted protein, and all isolates in which it was deleted displayed significantly reduced vegetative growth and asexual spore production compared to the wild-type isolates. In pathogenicity tests, lesions induced by the deletion mutants on detached Pinus patula branches were significantly shorter than those produced by the wild-types. The putative pathogenicity gene was named Pgs reflecting its role in pathogenicity, growth, and sporulation. Future research will seek to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the mutant phenotypes observed. Overall, this study represents a significant advance in F. circinatum research as the development and application of a Cas9-mediated gene deletion process opens new avenues for functional gene characterization underlying many of the pathogen's biological traits.","CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, Fusarium circinatum, Growth, Pathogenicity, Pgs gene, Sporulation"

Transcriptional activation of VRT-A2 due to a natural sequence variation in its Intron-1 region significantly enhances grain weight but also causes some basal spikelets to fail to completely develop, thus decreasing grain number per spike and yield. This yield penalty has presented a challenge for the use of VRT-A2 in breeding high-yield wheat. Here, we report the characterization of 2 regulatory modules that fine-tune VRT-A2 expression in bread wheat (T. aestivum): (i) the APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF)-type transcription factor MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 (TaMFS1) represses VRT-A2 expression by recruiting a transcriptional corepressor and a histone deacetylase and (ii) the STRUCTURE-SPECIFIC RECOGNITION PROTEIN 1 (TaSSRP1) facilitates VRT-A2 activation by assembling Mediator and further RNA polymerase II.

It is also recognized that the phenomenon of protein intrinsic disorder contains keys to answer numerous questions that do not have obvious solutions within the classic ""lock-and-key""-based structure-function paradigm. In fact, reality is much more complex than the traditional ""one-gene - one-protein - one-function"" model, as many (if not most) proteins are multifunctional. This multifunctionality is commonly rooted in the presence of the intrinsically disordered or structurally flexible regions in a protein. Here, in addition to various events at the DNA (genetic variations), mRNA (alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, alternative initiation of translation, and mRNA editing), and protein levels (post-translational modifications), intrinsic disorder and protein functionality are crucial for generation of proteoforms, which are functionally and structurally different protein forms produced from a single gene. Therefore, since a given protein exists as a dynamic conformational ensemble containing multiple proteoforms characterized by a broad spectrum of structural features and possessing various functional potentials, ""protein structure-function continuum"" model represents a more realistic way to correlate protein structure and function.","Alternative splicing, Induced fit, Intrinsically disordered protein, Intrinsically disordered region, Lock-and-key, Multifunctionality, Posttranslational modification, Protein interactions, Proteoform, Structure-function continuum"

The PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, are human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that act outside the cell by complexing circulating PCSK9 and thus preventing its binding to the LDLR. In contrast, inclisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA), inhibits hepatic synthesis of PCSK9, thereby resulting in reduced amounts of the protein inside and outside the cell. Both approaches result in decreased plasma LDL-C concentrations and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Marginally superior LDL-C reduction (≈ 60 %) is achieved with mAbs as compared to the siRNA (≈ 50 %); head-to-head comparisons are required to confirm between-class differences in efficacy. Both drug classes have shown variability in LDL-C lowering response between individuals in waterfall analyses. Whereas mAb-mediated inhibition leads to a compensatory increase in plasma PCSK9 levels, siRNA treatment reduces them. These agents differ in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, which may translate into distinct clinical opportunities under acute (e.g. acute coronary syndromes) as compared to chronic conditions. Both drug classes provide additional reduction in LDL-C levels (up to 50 %) beyond those achieved with statin therapy, facilitating attainment of guideline-recommended LDL-C goals in high and very high-risk patients. Additional PCSK9 inhibitors, including an oral macrocyclic peptide, a small PCSK9 binding protein and a novel small molecule, plus hepatic gene editing of PCSK9, are under development.

For example, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from loss of paternally expressed imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13.3, although the maternal allele is intact but epigenetically silenced. Using CRISPR repression and activation screens in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we identified genomic elements that control the expression of the PWS gene SNRPN from the paternal and maternal chromosomes. We showed that either targeted transcriptional activation or DNA demethylation can activate the silenced maternal SNRPN and downstream PWS transcripts. However, these two approaches function at unique regions, preferentially activating different transcript variants and involving distinct epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms. Remarkably, transient expression of the targeted demethylase leads to stable, long-term maternal SNRPN expression in PWS iPSCs. This work uncovers targeted epigenetic manipulations to reprogram a disease-associated imprinted locus and suggests possible therapeutic interventions.","CRISPR, DNA methylation, Prader-Willi Syndrome, dCas9, epigenome editing, imprinting"

Although there have been many scientific and clinical efforts to reduce the impact of mTOR hyperactivation on downstream cellular metabolism, we aimed to mitigate this hyperactivation through a novel targeted gene edit of the intrinsic mTOR inhibitor, DEP domain containing MTOR interacting protein (DEPTOR), in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Using publicly available bioinformatics tools, we demonstrate that DEPTOR gene expression is low in breast cancers compared with healthy tissues and that DEPTOR expression predicts overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. We show that a directed overexpression of DEPTOR protein leads to significant alteration of downstream mTORC1 targets and subsequently reduces overall rates of protein synthesis. In addition, treatment of DEPTOR overexpressing cells with small-molecule DEPTOR inhibitor NSC126405 leads to a reversal of this effect, indicating a direct causal mechanism between DEPTOR protein levels and mTORC1 activation.","CRISPSR/Cas9, cancer, mTOR, metabolism"

However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus's receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, Citrus PH4 (CitPH4), which encodes a MYB transcription factor that functions as a key regulator of CA accumulation, was upregulated in HLB-affected fruits relative to healthy fruits. Heterologous overexpression of CitPH4 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants enhanced tolerance to HLB.

This review analyzes the evolution of our understanding of 5'-UTR rG4-mediated translation regulation, from early discoveries of simple translation inhibitors to the current recognition of their multifaceted regulatory roles. We discuss canonical and non-canonical rG4 structures, their interactions with regulatory proteins, including helicases and FMRP, and their function in both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation. Special attention is given to the synergistic effects between rG4s and upstream open reading frames (uORFs), stress-responsive translation regulation, and their role in repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation linked to neurodegenerative diseases. We critically evaluate methodological challenges in the field, including limitations of current detection methods, reporter system artifacts, and the necessity to verify rG4 presence in endogenous transcripts. Recent technological advances, including genome editing and high-throughput sequencing approaches, have revealed that rG4 effects are more complex and context-dependent than initially thought. This review highlights the importance of developing more robust methodologies for studying rG4s at endogenous levels and carefully reevaluating previously identified targets, while emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets in various diseases.","5′-UTR, FMRP, IRES, RNA G-quadruplex, helicases, translation regulation"

However, contrary to the conventional idea, a single gene in mammalian cells can express multiple transcript variants translated into several different proteins. The transcript variants are generated through transcription from alternative start sites and alternative post-transcriptional processing of the precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). In addition, gene mutations and RNA editing further enhance the diversity of the transcript variants. The transcript variants can encode proteins with various domains, expanding the functional repertoire of a single gene. Some transcript variants may not encode proteins but function as non-coding RNAs and regulate gene expression. The expression level of the transcript variants may vary between cell types or within the same cells under different biological conditions. Transcript variants are characteristic of cell differentiation in a particular tissue, and the variants may play a key role in normal development and aging. Studies also reported that some transcript variants may have roles in disease pathogenesis. The biological significances urge studying the complexity of gene expression at the transcript level. This article updates the molecular basis of transcript variants in mammalian cells, including the formation mechanisms and potential roles in host biology.

The Cas9 inhibition by those polymers is dose-dependent, with varying efficiency to achieve 100% inhibition. Further biophysical studies revealed that PMLA-LLL directly binds the Cas9 protein, resulting in a substantial decrease in Cas9/sgRNA binding affinity. Transmission electron microscopy and molecular docking were performed to provide a possible binding mechanism for PMLA-LLL to interact with Cas9.

The standard gRNA scaffold contains a sequence of four thymine nucleotides (4T), which is known to inhibit transcription from Pol III promoters such as the U6 promoter. Our study showed that using standard plasmid transfection protocols, the presence of these 4Ts did not significantly affect editing efficiency, as most of the gRNAs tested (55 gRNAs) achieved near-perfect editing outcomes. We observed that gRNAs with lower activity were T-rich and had reduced gRNA transcript levels. However, this issue can be effectively resolved by increasing transcript levels, which can be readily achieved by shortening the 4T sequences. In this study, we demonstrated this by modifying the sequences to 3TC. Although the 3TC scaffold modification did not improve editing efficiency for already efficient gRNAs when high vector quantities were available, it proved highly beneficial under conditions of limited vector availability, where the 3TC scaffold yielded higher editing efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrated that the 3TC scaffold is compatible with SpCas9 high-fidelity variants and ABEmax base editing, enhancing their editing efficiency. Another commonly used natural Cas9 variant, SaCas9, also benefited from the 3TC scaffold sequence modification, which increased gRNA transcription and subsequently improved editing activity. This modification was applied to the EDIT-101 therapeutic strategy, where it demonstrated marked improvements in performance. This study highlights the importance of shortening the 4T sequences in the gRNA scaffold to optimize gRNA transcript expression for enhanced CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing efficiency. This optimization is particularly important for therapeutic applications, where the quantity of vector is often limited, ensuring more effective and optimal outcomes.","Base editing, CRISPR-Cas9, Editing efficiency, Gene editing, SaCas9, SpCas9, gRNA scaffold"

EXPERT exhibits prominent capacity in replacing sequences up to 88 base pairs and inserting sequences up to 100 base pairs within the upstream region of the ext-pegRNA nick. Compared to canonical PEs such as PE2, the utilization of the EXPERT strategy significantly enhances the editing efficiency for large fragment edits with an average improvement of 3.12-fold, up to 122.1 times higher. Safety wise, the use of ups-sgRNA does not increase the rates of undesirable insertions and deletions (indels), as the two nicks are on the same strand.

ATP, essential for energy in living organisms, plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes. To reduce the cost of ATP-requiring reactions, it is crucial to identify and efficiently express genes in ATP synthesis pathway. This study identified a single ppk gene (No.8) capable of completing the cyclic reaction.

With the rapid growth of the human population, the increasing pressure on rice systems for extensive and intensive farming is associated with an increase in GHG emissions that is impeding global efforts to mitigate climate change. The complex rice environment, with its genotypic variability among rice cultivars, as well as emerging farming practices and global climatic changes, are important challenges for research and development initiatives that aim to lower GHG emissions and increase crop productivity.

The improvements in cilia-associated protein localisation and traffic were accompanied by significant changes in the transcriptome towards control gene expression levels in many of the differentially expressed genes. In summary, iPSC-derived retinal organoids are a powerful model for investigating the molecular and cellular changes associated with loss of LCA5 function and highlight the therapeutic potential of small molecules to treat retinal ciliopathies.","Cilia, Gene editing, LCA, LCA5, Organoid, Photoreceptor, Retina, Retinal dystrophy, Stem cell, Therapy"

Lipase showed negative correlation with antioxidants and total phenolics. FAA can be used as marker for rancidity. Pearl millet is considered as ""Nutri-cereal"" due to its rich nutrient profile. Low keeping quality of the flour due to rancidity is one of the major problems in pearl millet. Lipases are a group of enzymes that produces free fatty acids that ultimately leads to rancidity. Very few lipases have been identified and characterized from pearl millet. Here, we have identified 2039 transcripts of lipases from pooled samples (leaf, stem and developing grains) of pearl millet using de novo transcriptomic approach and predicted 05 full length lipase variants. Further, we cloned 02 lipase genes-monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL, acc. no. MZ590564) and triacylglycerol lipase (TAGL, acc. no. MZ590565) of 1.5 kb each from pearl millet cv. Pusa-1201. Conserved domain search analysis showed the presence of catalytic triad [GXSXG] near the active site which is signature domain of lipase family of proteins. MAGL showed maximum expression in PC-701 and TAGL in Pusa-1201 during mealy-ripe growth stage of endospermic tissue. Abundance of transcripts of both the lipases was observed in the harvested grains of PC-701. We observed negative correlation between the lipase activity and accumulation of antioxidants like total phenolic content (TPC), tannin, and total antioxidant potential (TAP). Free amino acid and reducing sugar were observed as potential markers for accessing the intensity/extent of rancidity in pearl millet flour. Thus, there is need to explore and characterize the lipase variants to connect the missing dots in rancidity pathway and to use it in genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach for the development of pearl millet lines free of off-odor and flour rancidity.","Landraces, Lipase, Lipid, Pearl millet, Rancidity, TAC, TPC, Transcriptome"

Lack of oxygen within tissue spheroids hinders metabolism of cells and eventually leads to cell death. Prevention of necrosis is crucial to success of tissue engineering methods and such prevention requires estimation of cell viability in the spheroid. We propose a novel approach for numerical modeling of diffusion in tissue spheroids during their fusion. The approach is based on numerical solutions of partial differential equations and the application of Function Representation (FRep) framework for geometric modeling. We present modeling of oxygen diffusion based on meshes derived from the geometry of fusing spheroids, a method for selecting optimal spheroid size, and several statistics for estimating cellular viability. Our findings provide insights into oxygen diffusion in three-dimensional cell cultures thus improving the robustness of biotechnological methods that employ tissue spheroids.",N/A

Despite this importance, how IDRs influence gene expression, and how aberrant IDR fusion proteins provoke oncogenesis, remains incompletely understood. Here we develop a series of synthetic dCas9-IDR fusions to establish that locus-specific recruitment of IDRs can be sufficient to stimulate endogenous gene expression. Using dCas9 fused to the paradigmatic leukemogenic NUP98 IDR, we also demonstrate that IDRs can activate transcription via localized biomolecular condensation and in a manner that is dependent upon overall IDR concentration, local binding density, and amino acid composition. To better clarify the oncogenic role of IDRs, we construct clinically observed NUP98 IDR fusions and show that, while generally non-overlapping, oncogenic NUP98-IDR fusions convergently drive a core leukemogenic gene expression program in donor-derived human hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, we find that this leukemic program arises through differing mechanistic routes based upon IDR fusion partner; either distributed intragenic binding and intrachromosomal looping, or dense binding at promoters. Altogether, our studies clarify the gene-regulatory roles of IDRs and, for the NUP98 IDR, connect this capacity to pathological cellular programs, creating potential opportunities for generalized and mechanistically tailored therapies.",N/A

However, its function during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) remains unclear. In this study, we achieved GDF9 editing in approximately 59 % of cultured oocytes by cytoplasmic injection of a pre-assembled crRNA-tracrRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex into porcine oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. GDF9 editing caused significant damage to porcine oocytes during IVM. Additionally, GDF9 editing impaired mitochondrial function, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels. The impaired IVM of GDF9-edited porcine oocytes was primarily driven by active cAMP-PKA signaling, which inhibited MOS expression, leading to the activation of the WEE1B/MYT1 kinase and inactivation of CDC25B phosphatase. This cascade resulted in the inactivation of CDK1, thereby preventing the activation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) and inhibiting first polar body (PB1) extrusion. Our findings enhance the understanding of GDF9's regulatory role in porcine oocyte IVM and provide a theoretical foundation for improving porcine reproductive performance.","GDF9, Gene editing, Porcine oocytes"

This has led to interest in identifying alternative and renewable energy sources such as biofuel generation from photosynthetic organisms. A wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, known as microalgae, have the potential to be economical and ecologically sustainable in the manufacture of biofuels such as bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bio-oils, and bio-syngas. By using contemporary bioengineering techniques, the innate potential of algae to produce biomass of superior quality may be enhanced. In algal biotechnology, directed genome modification via RNA-guided endonucleases is a new approach. CRISPR/Cas systems have recently been frequently used to modify the genetic makeup of several aquatic and freshwater microalgae. The majority of research has used the Cas9-driven Type II system, one of two classes and six unique kinds of CRISPR systems, to specifically target desired genes in algae, and knock them out and down, or both. Using CRISPR technology to modify its genetic makeup, microalgae has produced more biomass and increased in lipid content.

However, little attention has been paid to what other types of RNA, besides the target RNA, are encapsulated into VLPs, leading to a lack of knowledge of the landscape of RNA cargoes. In this work, we engineered the widely used MS2 VLPs to encapsulate a model cargo mRNA in yeast, with the packaging efficiency and specificity being quantitatively tuned by the copy number of packaging signals.

Some important genes regulating rice tillering have been identified, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP) encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor. Beyond its well-established role in promoting spikelet formation during the reproductive phase, here we demonstrate that FZP also inhibits axillary buds outgrowth in the vegetative phase by suppressing the expression of a MADS-box gene (OsMADS57) that functions as a growth promoter. Consequently, genome editing of the FZP-bound cis-motif in the promoter of OsMADS57 releases its expression, leading to more tillers. Furthermore, domestication analysis shows that FZP has undergone strong selection in cultivated rice, while the downstream gene OsMADS57 has been differentiated between indica and japonica subspecies. Four functional SNPs in the promoter of OsMADS57 can increase rice tillering in most indica accessions by enhancing its expression. Our findings expose hidden pleiotropy of classic spikelet identity genes that are redeployed to control stem form, potentially enriching the gene resources for rice genetic improvement.","FZP, OsMADS57, differentiation, domestication, rice, tiller number"

A remaining obstacle is that such transplanted cells have to develop into functional light-sensitive photoreceptors, which require outer segment formation and interaction with the underlying retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). To overcome this limitation, a combination of cell therapy and optogenetics allows to confer light sensitivity to the donor cells thanks to the expression of a microbial opsin and therefore independently of the formation of mature outer segment or RPE contact. To ensure stable and homogenous expression of the microbial opsin in photoreceptors, we inserted the coding sequence of the red-light sensitive chloride pump Jaws under specific photoreceptor promoter into the iPSC genome, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system at the safe AAVS1 locus. We successfully generated a knock-in Jaws-EGFP iPSC line and validated its stemness and pluripotency status.

Cas12a processes unique features as compared to other CRISPR effector nucleases such as Cas9, and has been demonstrated as an effective tool for manipulating complex genomes. Prior studies have indicated that DNA flexibility at the region adjacent to the protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) contributes to Cas12a target recognition. Here, we adapted a SELEX-seq approach to further examine the connection between PAM-adjacent DNA flexibility and off-target binding by Cas12a. A DNA library containing DNA-DNA mismatches at PAM + 1 to + 6 positions was generated and subjected to binding in vitro with FnCas12a in the absence of pairing between the RNA guide and DNA target. The bound and unbound populations were sequenced to determine the propensity for off-target binding for each of the individual sequences. Analyzing the position and nucleotide dependency of the DNA-DNA mismatches showed that PAM-dependent Cas12a off-target binding requires unpairing of the protospacer at PAM + 1 and increases with unpairing at PAM + 2 and + 3. This revealed that PAM-adjacent DNA flexibility can tune Cas12a off-target binding.

Previous analysis of whole genome sequencing and comparative proteomics has revealed that a sulfatase named LPMS in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum dy-1 (L. plantarum dy-1) was the potential key enzyme in promoting the release of bound phenol from barley bran dietary fiber. In this present study, we utilized gene editing technology to modify dy-1 to verify the key role of LPMS in releasing the bond phenolic acids during dy-1 fermentation. Results showed that lpms knockout and overexpression strains (dy-1-∆LPMS and dy-1-OELPMS) were successfully constructed, evidenced by the lpms gene level and sequencing. lpms editing delayed the exponential period of dy-1 growth but had little effect on the stable period. Fermented barley bran dietary fiber (FBDF) by dy-1, dy-1-∆LPMS, and dy-1-OELPMS demonstrated lower molecular weight, rougher surface morphology, looser microstructure, and decreased crystallinity, among which dy-1-∆LPMS showed the least influence. Confocal laser scanning microscope results illustrated that the colocalization between bound phenolic acids and dietary fibers was more apparent under dy-1-ΔLPMS fermentation. Furthermore, knockout of lpms significantly declined the release of bond phenolic acids, especially for the hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, resulting in the lower antioxidant capacities (p < 0.05). In all, we confirmed that the sulfatase LPMS in L. plantarum dy-1 played great part in releasing the bond phenolic acids from barley bran dietary fiber, therefore improving the bioactivity of released phenolic acids. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study confirmed the sulfatase LPMS in L. plantarum dy-1 played key role in releasing the bond phenolic acids during fermentation of barley bran dietary fiber. In the future, heterologously expressed LPMSs have great potential applications in the brewing and feed industries, among others, which could increase the nutritional and commercial value of byproducts.","Lactiplantibacillus plantarum dy‐1, barley bran dietary fiber, bound phenolic acids, gene editing, sulfatase"

To maintain such engraftment levels, we and others have pursued approaches to shield edited cells from antibody or CAR T-cell mediated selection. Here we focused on CD33, which is expressed early on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) as well as on myeloid progenitors. Rhesus macaques were engrafted with HSPCs edited to ablate CD33 utilizing either CRISPR/Cas9 or adenine base editor.

We then created a V-set domain specific chimeric antigen receptor construct (CAR33), validated its functionality in vitro, and treated both animals with autologous CAR33 T cells. CAR33 T cells expanded after infusion and caused specific depletion of CD33WT but not CD33null progeny - leading to a transient enrichment for gene-edited cells in the blood. No depletion was seen in the bone marrow stem cell compartment with CD34+CD90+ HSCs expressing lower levels of CD33 in comparison to monocytes.

In addition, Lp(a) may cause atherothrombosis through interactions between apoA (apolipoprotein A) and the platelet PAR-1 (protease-activated receptor 1) receptor, as well as competitive inhibition of plasminogen. Because Lp(a) is mostly determined on genetic bases, a 1-time assessment in a lifetime can suffice to identify patients with elevated levels. Mendelian randomization studies and post hoc analyses of randomized trials of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs showed a causal link between Lp(a) concentrations and cardiovascular outcomes, with therapeutic reduction of Lp(a) expected to contribute to estimated cardiovascular risk mitigation. Many Lp(a)-lowering drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, small interfering ribonucleic acids, antisense oligonucleotides, small molecules, and gene editing compounds, are at different stages of clinical investigation and show promise for clinical use. In particular, increased Lp(a) testing and treatment are expected to have a substantial impact at the population level, enabling the identification of high-risk individuals and the subsequent prevention of a large number of cardiovascular events. Ongoing phase 3 trials will further elucidate the cardiovascular benefits of Lp(a) reduction over the long term, offering potential avenues for targeted interventions and improved cardiovascular outcomes.","cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular risk, lipid metabolism, lipoprotein (a)"
39928547,Flexibility in PAM recognition expands DNA targeting in xCas9.,eLife,2025,"Kazi A Hossain, Lukasz Nierzwicki, Modesto Orozco, Jacek Czub, Giulia Palermo","xCas9 is an evolved variant of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, engineered to improve specificity and reduce undesired off-target effects. How xCas9 expands the DNA targeting capability of Cas9 by recognising a series of alternative protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences while ignoring others is unknown. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying xCas9's expanded PAM recognition and provide critical insights for expanding DNA targeting. We demonstrate that while wild-type Cas9 enforces stringent guanine selection through the rigidity of its interacting arginine dyad, xCas9 introduces flexibility in R1335, enabling selective recognition of specific PAM sequences. This increased flexibility confers a pronounced entropic preference, which also improves recognition of the canonical TGG PAM. Furthermore, xCas9 enhances DNA binding to alternative PAM sequences during the early evolution cycles, while favouring binding to the canonical PAM in the final evolution cycle. This dual functionality highlights how xCas9 broadens PAM recognition and underscores the importance of fine-tuning the flexibility of the PAM-interacting cleft as a key strategy for expanding the DNA targeting potential of CRISPR-Cas systems. These findings deepen our understanding of DNA recognition in xCas9 and may apply to other CRISPR-Cas systems with similar PAM recognition requirements.","CRISPR-Cas9, RNA, S. pyogenes, entropy, genome editing, molecular biophysics, protein dynamics, protein-DNA, structural biology"

Solid tumors present the next challenge due to their extremely complicated microenvironment and structural characteristics. Targeting efficiency and persistence are currently bottleneck issues in the clinical treatment of CAR-T. Beyond drugs and cytokines, biomaterials can modulate the immune response, assisting adoptive CAR-T cells in exerting their function. In this study, a supramolecular peptide hydrogel epitope vaccine was designed to serve as both a preparation medium and a reservoir for CAR-T cells. The self-assembling peptide formed a nanofiber scaffold through non-covalent interactions of amphiphilic amino acids and ion stabilizers. Firstly, the complementary peptide conjugated vaccine epitopes and CAR-T target sites were derived from different extracellular domains of the HER2 protein, and the combination treatment improved tumor antigen spreading and targeting efficiency. The epitope hydrogel promoted CAR-T cell proliferation, cytotoxic activity, and lymphocyte subpopulation transformation. Furthermore, the supramolecular peptide epitope vaccine encapsulated CAR-T (SPEV-CAR-T) induced endogenous humoral and cellular immune responses through a sustained release of the hydrogel and CAR-T cells, demonstrating superior anti-tumor effects in an in vivo mouse model. Most importantly, SPEV-CAR-T induced central memory cells in systemic immune tissues, addressing the poor persistence of single CAR-T therapy. The integration and complementation of active and passive immune responses in this all-in-one hydrogel epitope vaccine and CAR-T system facilitated a sequential succession of endogenous and exogenous immune responses, promoting persistent and specific tumor attack. SPEV-CAR-T showed superior therapeutic effects in solid tumors.","Active and passive immune responses, CAR-T cells, Epitope vaccine, Memory cells, Supramolecular peptide hydrogel"

As an important approach to the origination of new genes, gene duplication contributes to around half of the genes in eukaryotic genomes, facilitating the adaptive evolution of species. Over the past fifty years, especially since entering the genomics era in the last two decades, there have been extensive and profound discussions on the mechanisms, evolutionary processes and forces behind the emergence of duplicate genes. Sequence similarity of duplicate genes often leads to functional redundancy, enhancing organismal robustness. Conversely, functional divergence can create novel functions and improve evolvability. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of gene duplication, the fate and the evolutionary models of duplicate genes. This article concludes by outlining how long-read sequencing technologies, gene editing, and various other high-throughput techniques will further advance our understanding of the role of duplicate genes in the genetics-development-evolution network.","functional redundancy, gene duplication, neofunctionalization, retroposition, subfunctionalization, whole genome duplication"

Understanding the mechanism underlying plant polyploid phenotype variation is a critical prerequisite for effectively utilizing polyploid resources. In this study, we induced and obtained autotetraploid birch along with its diploid parent. Comparative analysis revealed significant differences in the morphology of leaves and stems between them. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 3.86% of genes showed significant differential expression between diploids and tetraploids. The genes significantly downregulated in tetraploids were primarily associated with functional terms related to hormone regulation, plant development, and morphogenesis. Notably, a group of genes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis was downregulated in tetraploids, and the level of active BRs in tetraploids was significantly lower than that in diploids. A Cas9/gRNA gene editing method was used to perform functional deletion mutations on BpCYP90C1. The knockout of BpCYP90C1 resulted in limited biosynthesis of 6-deoxoCS and CS in plants. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, the bpcyp90c1 mutants exhibited a significant increase in leaf epidermal cell and a decrease in the number of leaf epidermal cells. The bpcyp90c1 mutants had curled leaves with obvious serrated edges and cordate base. Furthermore, the height and internode spacing of the bpcyp90c1 mutants were shorter. These phenotypic variations were similar to those of tetraploid birch. This indicates that the decrease in active BR levels was an important factor affecting the variation of tetraploid leaves and stems.

Currently, the therapeutic landscape for SCI is notably sparse, with limited effective treatment options available. Methylprednisolone (MP), a widely used clinical anti-inflammatory agent for SCI, requires administration in high doses that are associated with significant adverse effects. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach by substituting cholesterol with MP to engineer a novel Lipid Nanoparticle (MP-LNP). This strategy aims to enhance the localization and concentration of MP at the injury site, thereby amplifying its therapeutic efficacy while mitigating systemic side effects. Furthermore, we explore the integration of C3 transferase mRNA into MP-LNPs. C3 transferase, a potent inhibitor of the RhoA pathway, has shown promise in facilitating neurological recovery in animal models of SCI and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The novel formulation, MP-LNP-C3, is designed for direct administration to the injury site during decompression surgery, offering a targeted therapeutic modality for SCI. Our findings reveal several significant advantages of this approach: Firstly, the incorporation of C3 transferase mRNA into MP-LNPs does not compromise the structural integrity of the nanoparticles, ensuring efficient mRNA expression within the spinal cord. Secondly, the MP-LNP formulation effectively attenuates inflammation and reduces the adverse effects associated with high-dose MP treatment in the acute phase of SCI. Lastly, MP-LNP-C3 demonstrates notable neuroprotective properties and promotes enhanced recovery of motor function in SCI mouse models. Together, these results underscore the potential of this innovative LNP-based therapy as a promising avenue for advancing the treatment of clinical SCI.","Anti-inflammation, C3 transferase, LNP, Methylprednisolone, Neuroprotection, Spinal cord injury"

However, primary cells generally more difficult to transfect and perform gene editing. To date, most related studies have used more vigorous fetal fibroblasts as donor cells, while using somatic cells from adult animals requires more post-editing screening efforts due to the low yield of edited cells. Here, we performed electroporation on adult bovine ear fibroblasts (BEFs) under various conditions such as electrical pulse settings, plasmid dosage, cell density, and concentration of electroporation buffer, and evaluated the transfect efficiency using flow cytometry analysis. We confirmed that the 270 V-10-10 program (270 V, 10 ms, 10 cycles) using 1.5 million cells and 5 µg of EGFP plasmid yielded the highest number of EGFP positive cells. Additionally, we used prime editor (PE) to edit the MSTN locus in BEFs.

However, traditional chemical synthesis methods face challenges, such as high costs, low yields, and poor stability, limiting the large-scale industrial production of AMPs. Despite extensive research to improve AMP production efficiency, issues such as low yields and complex extraction processes continue to pose significant barriers to commercial application. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new biosynthesis strategies and optimization methods to enhance AMP production efficiency and quality.

Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases whose efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context. Here, we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. Using an in vivo reporter strategy, we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes. We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant.

Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play a key role in this process. To establish a system for gene expression manipulation in genetically inaccessible mitochondria, we engineered a synthetic PPR protein, dPPR-nad7-DYW, to induce de novo C-to-U editing in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7 (nad7) mRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana, thereby creating a premature stop codon. This designer protein, composed of 13 P-type PPR domains, was fused with the DYW-type cytidine deaminase domain from Physcomitrium patens PpPPR_56 and programmed to bind a specific nad7 mRNA segment. In vitro binding assays confirmed the specificity of dPPR-nad7-DYW for its target sequence. When expressed in Arabidopsis plants, dPPR-nad7-DYW achieved up to 85% editing efficiency at the target site, successfully introducing a premature stop codon in nad7 mRNA. This resulted in reduced polysome loading of nad7 transcripts and a phenotype characteristic of mitochondrial complex I dysfunction.

However, significant technical challenges remain, including low productivity, altered efficacy of plant-derived proteins, along with issues in culture process development, such as cell clumping, genetic instability, and difficulties with cryopreservation. To date, the full production potential of this platform remains largely untapped. This review addresses these critical challenges and proposes innovative strategies to unlock the full potential of the production platform. Rather than simply revisiting past advancements or summarizing current progress, it proposes forward-thinking solutions with a particular emphasis on cellular engineering. Key strategies include designing novel protein partners to enhance recombinant protein accumulation and functionality, employing precise gene integration techniques in genome to enhance transgene transcription, implementing cutting-edge methods for screening and maintaining elite cell lines to mitigate genetic instability, and leveraging genome editing tools for cellular engineering to develop new plant cell lines optimized for bioproduction. A key focus is on cell wall engineering to develop cellulose- or pectin-deficient cell lines, facilitating modifications to the morphology of existing plant cell lines. By exploring these innovative approaches, this review aims to foster innovative thinking and inspire future research in plant cell-based bioproduction.","Cell wall engineering, Cellular engineering, Genome editing, Plant cell-based bioproduction, Recombinant proteins"

Hypoxia drives CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) induction through hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), which promotes EMT, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We find that hypoxia significantly increases CTCF occupancy at various EMT-related genes. We present a CTCF-mediated intricate mechanism promoting EMT wherein CTCF binding at the collagen type V alpha 1 chain (COL5A1) promoter is crucial for COL5A1 upregulation under hypoxia. Additionally, hypoxia drives exon64A inclusion in a mutually exclusive alternative splicing event of COL5A1exon64 (exon64A/64B). Notably, CTCF mediates COL5A1 promoter-alternatively spliced exon upstream looping that regulates DNA demethylation at distal exon64A. This further regulates the CTCF-mediated RNA polymerase II pause at COL5A1exon64A, leading to its inclusion in promoting the EMT under hypoxia. Genome-wide study indicates the association of gained CTCF occupancy with the alternative splicing of many cancer-related genes, similar to the proposed model. Specifically, disrupting the HIF1α-CTCF-COL5A1exon64A axis through the dCas9-DNMT3A system alleviates the EMT in hypoxic cancer cells and may represent a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.","COL5A1, CP: Cancer, CP: Molecular biology, CRISPR-dCas9-mediated editing, CTCF, EMT, alternative splicing, breast cancer, epigenetics, hypoxia, promoter-exon upstream looping"

Recently, gene editing of hematopoietic stem cells has been conducted to induce erythroid differentiation in vitro for producing sufficient RBCs to meet the imbalance in blood supply and demand. The differentiation and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are regulated by transcription factors, such as high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). In this study, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to establish a doxycycline-inducible HMGA2-expressing human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line. In a defined erythroid differentiation system, HMGA2 prolonged erythroid differentiation in vitro, enabling extensive expansion of human erythroblasts. The erythroblasts derived from the HMGA2-expressing hESC line are rich in polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts expressing mostly α- and γ-globin and have the capacity to differentiate into RBCs.

However, the shortage of available organ donors fails to meet the rapidly growing transplantation demand. Due to the high similarity of liver tissue structure and metabolism between miniature pigs and humans, xenotransplantation of pig livers is considered as a potentially viable solution to organ scarcity. In the 2024, teams from China first time have successfully transplanted a genetically modified Bama miniature pig liver into a clinically brain-dead man lasting for 10 days. This milestone in human xenotransplantation research not only confirms the feasibility of clinical application of xenotransplantation, but also underscores the daunting and protracted nature of this pathway. Despite advanced gene-editing technologies theoretically circumventing the occurrence of most transplant rejection reactions, patients still face challenges such as chronic immune rejection, coagulation disorders, and thrombotic microangiopathy after receiving xenografts. Moreover, prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs may induce irreversible immune dysfunction, leading to opportunistic infections and metabolic disorders. This article compares the similarities and differences in livers between humans and pigs, summarizes the immunometabolism of xenotransplantation based on current findings, and provides research perspectives on pre-transplantation and post-transplantation strategies for prolonging the survival time of xenografts.","Treg, antigens, immunometabolism, liver, xenograft rejection"

Mice with this insertion developed similar phenotypes to Zic3LacZ null mice, including heterotaxy, isolated heart defects, neural tube defects and tail kinks. Surprisingly, gene expression analysis revealed that the novel Zic3ins5V line displays higher levels of Zic3 mRNA, but western blot analysis confirmed that levels of ZIC3 were greatly reduced in vivo. RNAfold, a RNA secondary structure prediction tool, showed that this mis-insertion may cause the formation of a large stem-loop hairpin incorporating some of the 5'UTR and first exon of Zic3, and the insertion of similar hairpins in a cell-based assay caused the loss of ZIC3.

Its application reduces the reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, thereby supporting the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices. This study achieved efficient production of putrescine in Serratia marcescens. S. marcescens has been extensively used to synthesize antimicrobial substances and express proteins, but its application has been limited by the lack of efficient genome-editing tools. This study presents a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool for gene editing in S. marcescens. A dual-plasmid system was constructed, incorporating an editing template into the plasmid pEdit with target-specific sgRNA. A stationary phase promoter was used to express Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes protein, avoiding the need for additional inducers and ensuring efficient one-step gene knockout and integration. The tool demonstrated over 80% editing efficiency across various S. marcescens strains and enabled successful single-base mutations. Using this tool, we enhanced putrescine production in S. marcescens HBQA7, optimizing the expression of ornithine decarboxylase from Clostridium aceticum DSM1496 with the P2 promoter and identifying the optimal integration site.

Novel cereals with enhanced photosynthesis and assimilation of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and ozone, and tailored straw suitable for industrial manufacturing, open a new perspective for the circular economy. Here we describe the vision, strategies, and objectives of BEST-CROP, a Horizon-Europe and United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded project that relies on an alliance of academic plant scientists teaming up with plant breeding companies and straw processing companies to use the major advances in photosynthetic knowledge to improve barley biomass and to exploit the variability of barley straw quality and composition. We adopt the most promising strategies to improve the photosynthetic properties and ozone assimilation capacity of barley: (i) tuning leaf chlorophyll content and modifying canopy architecture; (ii) increasing the kinetics of photosynthetic responses to changes in irradiance; (iii) introducing photorespiration bypasses; (iv) modulating stomatal opening, thus increasing the rate of carbon dioxide fixation and ozone assimilation. We expect that by improving our targeted traits we will achieve increases in aboveground total biomass production without modification of the harvest index, with added benefits in sustainability via better resource-use efficiency of water and nitrogen. In parallel, the resulting barley straw is tailored to: (i) increase straw protein content to make it suitable for the development of alternative biolubricants and feed sources; (ii) control cellulose/lignin contents and lignin properties to develop straw-based construction panels and polymer composites. Overall, by exploiting natural- and induced-genetic variability as well as gene editing and transgenic engineering, BEST-CROP will lead to multi-purpose next generation barley cultivars supporting sustainable agriculture and capable of straw-based applications.","barley, biolubricants, canopy photosynthesis, circular bioeconomy, composites, feed, straw quality, straw‐based panels"

The advent of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has marked a turning point in genetic manipulation, with applications across multiple Leptospira species. However, incorporating controlled protein expression into existing genetic tools could further expand their utility. We developed and demonstrated the functionality of IPTG-inducible heterologous protein expression in Leptospira spp. This system was applied for regulated expression of dead Cas9 (dCas9) to generate knockdown mutants, and Cas9 to produce knockout mutants by inducing double-strand breaks (DSB) into desired targets. IPTG-induced dCas9 expression enabled validation of essential genes and non-coding RNAs. Additionally, IPTG-controlled Cas9 expression combined with a constitutive non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) system allowed for successful recovery of knockout mutants, even in the absence of IPTG.

However, gaining biological insights from these genetic discoveries remain challenging because of linkage disequilibrium and the difficulty to interpret the functions of non-coding regulatory elements in the human genome. In this review, we present different statistical methods (e.g. Mendelian randomization) and molecular datasets (e.g. expression or protein quantitative trait loci) that have helped connect CAD-associated variants with genes, biological pathways, and cell-types or tissues. We emphasize that these various strategies make predictions, which need to be validated in orthologous systems. We discuss specific examples where the integration of omics data with GWAS results has prioritized causal CAD variants and genes. Finally, we review how targeted and genome-wide genome editing experiments using the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox have been used to characterize new CAD genes in human cells.

H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs infection up-regulate the expression of C4BPM in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1). To verify the role of C4BPM in replication of AIVs, C4BPM knockout (C4BPM-KO) and stable overexpressing (C4BPM-overexpressing) DF-1 cells were generated using lentivirus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology and molecular cloning strategies.

However, the replication of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs in C4BPM-KO DF-1 cells were inhibited with the increased expression of above related anti-viral factors. Further results showed that C4BPM did not affect viral adsorption, while, promote the entry of H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs.

By quantifying the fitness of tumors with every single and double mutant genotype, we show that most tumor suppressor genetic interactions exhibited negative epistasis, with diminishing returns on tumor fitness. In contrast, Apc inactivation showed positive epistasis with the inactivation of several other genes, including synergistic effects on tumor fitness in combination with Lkb1 or Nf1 inactivation.

The mutation occurred in the splice acceptor site of the first intron, resulting in a premature stop codon in BGI1. We validated the function of BGI1 using loss-of-function EMS and gene editing knockout mutants, both of which displayed reddish-brown pigmentation in lignified tissues. BGI1 knockout mutants exhibited reduced lignin content and shearing force relative to wild type, while BGI1 overexpression transgenic plants showed increased lignin content and enhanced disease resistance against common root rot and Fusarium crown rot. We confirmed that BGI1 exhibits CAD activity both in vitro and in vivo, playing an important role in lignin biosynthesis. BGI1 was highly expressed in the stem and spike, with its localisation observed in the cytoplasm. Transcriptome analysis revealed the regulatory networks associated with BGI1. Finally, we demonstrated that BGI1 interacts with TaPYL-1D, potentially involved in the abscisic acid signalling pathway. The identification and functional characterisation of BGI1 significantly advance our understanding of CAD proteins in lignin biosynthesis and plant defence against pathogen infection in wheat.","Aegilops tauschii, brown glume and internode 1, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, lignin, pathogen resistance, wheat"

However, their low frequency in peripheral blood poses challenges for both manufacturing and clinical application. Chimeric antigen receptors have been used to redirect the specificity of Tregs, using retroviral vectors. However, retroviral gene transfer is costly, time consuming, and raises safety issues. Here, we explored non-viral CRISPR-Cas12a gene editing to redirect Tregs, using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-specific constructs for proof-of-concept studies in transplantation models. Knock-in of an antigen-binding domain into the N terminus of CD3 epsilon (CD3ε) gene generates Tregs expressing a chimeric CD3ε-T cell receptor fusion construct (TRuC) protein that integrates into the endogenous TCR/CD3 complex. These CD3ε-TRuC Tregs exhibit potent antigen-dependent activation while maintaining responsiveness to TCR/CD3 stimulation. This enables preferential enrichment of TRuC-redirected Tregs over CD3ε knockout Tregs via repetitive CD3/CD28 stimulation in a good manufacturing practice-compatible expansion system.

In Escherichia coli, the acetic acid synthesis pathway, regulated by the poxB and pta genes, facilitates carbon consumption during cytidine production. To mitigate carbon source loss, the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique was employed to knock out the poxB and pta genes in E. coli, generating the engineered strains K12ΔpoxB and K12ΔpoxBΔpta. After 39 h of fermentation in 500 mL shake flasks, the cytidine yields of strains K12ΔpoxB and K12ΔpoxBΔpta were 1.91 ± 0.04 g/L and 18.28 ± 0.22 g/L, respectively. Disruption of the poxB and pta genes resulted in reduced acetic acid production and glucose consumption. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that impairing the acetic acid metabolic pathway in E. coli effectively redirected carbon flux toward cytidine biosynthesis, yielding a 5.26-fold reduction in acetate metabolism and an 11.56-fold increase in cytidine production. These findings provide novel insights into the influence of the acetate metabolic pathway on cytidine biosynthesis in E. coli.","Escherichia coli, Acetate metabolism, Carbon metabolic flux, Cytidine"

This groundbreaking technology holds immense potential for the development of targeted therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancers, genetic disorders, and hereditary diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing is a multi-step process such as designing a precise gRNA, selecting the appropriate Cas protein, and thoroughly evaluating both on-target and off-target activity of the Cas9-gRNA complex. To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 system, after the targeted DNA cleavage, the process requires careful analysis of the resultant outcomes such as indels and deletions. Following the success of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, researchers are now leveraging AI algorithms to catalyze and optimize the multi-step process of CRISPR-Cas9 system. To achieve this goal AI-driven applications are being integrated into each step, but existing AI predictors have limited performance and many steps still rely on expensive and time-consuming wet-lab experiments. The primary reason behind low performance of AI predictors is the gap between CRISPR and AI fields. Effective integration of AI into multi-step CRISPR-Cas9 system demands comprehensive knowledge of both domains. This paper bridges the knowledge gap between AI and CRISPR-Cas9 research. It offers a unique platform for AI researchers to grasp deep understanding of the biological foundations behind each step in the CRISPR-Cas9 multi-step process. Furthermore, it provides details of 80 available CRISPR-Cas9 system-related datasets that can be utilized to develop AI-driven applications. Within the landscape of AI predictors in CRISPR-Cas9 multi-step process, it provides insights of representation learning methods, machine and deep learning methods trends, and performance values of existing 50 predictive pipelines.

We describe novel method for E12.5 mouse embryos whole embryo culture system, which maintains embryo viability for 24 h. The culture system is based on the bubbling of pure oxygen through the culture medium. The oxygen was obtained by a chemical method. Each tube containing three embryos held 8 ml of culture medium composed of 6 ml of FBS, 2 ml of DMEM/F12, 80 μl of 40 % glucose and 30 μl of antibiotics (a mixture of penicillin 5000 UI/ml and streptomycin 5000 μg/ml). We observed initiation of auricle formation, as well as progression of eye development. Embryo viability was confirmed by the presence of heartbeat. The ratio of viable embryos after 24 h of culture was 27,78 %. However, many viable embryos exhibited massive hemorrhage attributed to oxygen insufficiency. The described culture system may be useful for the investigation of teratogenic compounds on the development of organs. Nonetheless, it is not suitable for ex utero culture of mouse embryos at more advanced stages due to the fact that embryos at such stages require more oxygen for the development than can be dissolved in the culture medium and consumed by embryos through diffusion.

Synthetic gene drives promise more efficient approaches since they can increase in frequency from rare, yet this also allows them to spread across a landscape, which may not always be desired. Between these two extremes are selectively neutral genetic constructs which persist at the frequency they are released, offering the potential for efficient suppression that remains localized. One way to achieve this would be to have perfect balance, at all construct frequencies, between gene drive increasing frequency and selection decreasing it. Here, we describe a way to closely approximate this balance using a toxin-antidote genetic construct that causes recessive lethality or sterility, encodes a genomic editor that makes dominant lethal or sterile edits in the genome, and provides protection against the action or consequences of the editing. Computer modeling shows that this design can be 100-fold more efficient than sterile males, increasing to 1,000-fold when released alongside a genetic booster. We describe designs for CRISPR-based molecular construction, including options that avoid using recoded genes as antidotes.","drive—selection balance, genetic biocontrol, population genetic engineering, population suppression"

The detection and molecular characterization of various begomoviruses species have been done with regard to phylogenetic analyses, infectivity on host plants, DNA replication, transgenic resistance, promoter analysis, and development of virus-based gene-silencing vectors using several techniques. The molecular detection of begomoviruses involves a variety of techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using degenerate primers, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), real time quantitative PCR, rolling-circle amplification PCR (RCA-PCR assay), RCA, and microarray/DNA chip.

DNA methylation is one of the most important and well-characterized epigenetic modifications in mammals, and while many different forms of dCas-based DNA methyltransferases (dCas-DNMTs) have been developed for programmable DNA methylation, these tools are frequently poorly tolerated and/or lowly expressed in mammalian cell types. Further, the use of dCas-DNMTs has largely been restricted to cell lines, which limits mechanistic insights in karyotypically normal contexts and hampers translational utility in the longer term. Here, we extend previous insights into the rational design of the catalytic core of the mammalian DNMT3A methyltransferase and test three dCas9-DNMT3A/3L variants across different human cell lines and in primary donor-derived human T cells. We find that mutations within the catalytic core of DNMT3A stabilize the expression of dCas9-DNMT3A/3L fusion proteins in Jurkat T cells without sacrificing DNA methylation or gene-silencing performance. We also show that these rationally engineered mutations in DNMT3A alter DNA methylation profiles at loci targeted with dCas9-DNMT3A/3L in cell lines and donor-derived human T cells. Finally, we leverage the transcriptionally repressive effects of dCas9-DNMT3A/3L variants to functionally link the expression of a key immunomodulatory transcription factor to cytokine secretion in donor-derived T cells.

Here, we demonstrate successful gene editing in both nuclei of a dikaryotic strain of Ganoderma lucidum using the Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). The RNP targeting the pyrG gene was introduced into dikaryotic protoplasts of G. lucidum, resulting in the isolation of 31 mycelial colonies resistant to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Twenty-six of these isolates were confirmed as dikaryotic strains by the presence of two distinct A mating type markers, denoted as A1 and A2. All dikaryons exhibited clamp connections on their mycelial hyphae, while the remaining 5 transformants were monokaryotic. Subsequent sequence analysis of PCR amplicons targeting pyrG revealed that two dikaryons harbored disrupted pyrG in both nuclei (pyrG-/pyrG-), while 10 and 14 displayed pyrG+/pyrG- (A1/A2) and pyrG-/pyrG+ (A1/A2) configurations, respectively. The disruption was achieved through non-homologous end joining repair, involving deletion or insertion of DNA fragments at the site of the double-strand break induced by RNP. Importantly, the nuclei were stable throughout 10 serial transfers over a period of 6 months. These findings highlight the capability of RNP to target genes across multiple nuclei within the same cytoplasm.","dikaryotic, gene editing, heterokaryosis, mushroom"

Wine lactone correlates with both precursor ((E)-8-carboxylinalool) concentration and wine age that has the greatest contribution to bouquet. In wine grape, cytochrome P450 VvCYP76F14 can catalyze trisubstrate-triproduct reaction processes (hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and carboxylation) to produce (E)-8-carboxylinalool. However, the exact mechanism of the whole reaction is unclear. Here, we unraveled the multi-catalysis mechanism with the aim of rapid conversion of linalool into (E)-8-carboxylinalool in winemaking. Results showed that the redox partner NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (VvCPR1) was indispensable for hydroxylation and carboxylation, but not dehydrogenation oxidation. Furthermore, the VvCYP76F14-VvCPR1 complex was introduced in the aging stage of winemaking and results showed that the complex could improve the bouquet by increasing the content of wine lactone and shortening the aging time.

Since postnatal neurons and astrocytes are mostly non-replicating, gene therapy and genome editing present enormous promise in child neurology. Unlike in other organs, which are highly permissive to adeno-associated viruses (AAV), the mature blood-brain barrier (BBB) greatly limits circulating AAV distribution to the brain. Intrathecal administration improves distribution but to no more than 20% of brain cells. Focused ultrasound (FUS) opens the BBB transiently and safely. In the present work we opened the hippocampal BBB and delivered a Cas9 gene via AAV9 intrathecally. This allowed brain first-pass, and subsequent vascular circulation and re-entry through the opened BBB. The mouse model used was of Lafora disease, a neuroinflammatory disease due to accumulations of misshapen overlong-branched glycogen. Cas9 was targeted to the gene of the glycogen branch-elongating enzyme glycogen synthase. We show that FUS dramatically (2000-fold) improved hippocampal Cas9 distribution and greatly reduced the pathogenic glycogen accumulations and hippocampal inflammation.

In this study, we identified the key gene RACK1 and its novel mutation RACK1-p.L206P as being associated with seizures through single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) and whole exome sequencing (WES) techniques. Our findings reveal that the RACK1-p.L206P mutation significantly enhances proliferation, migration, phagocytic ability, and inflammatory activation in human microglia, which in turn affects neuronal excitability and synaptic function, culminating in typical seizure symptoms in the seizures. These effects were further validated in a mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Mutant microglia exhibited increased activation and induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, leading to higher action potential frequency and excitatory synaptic marker expression. In vivo experiments demonstrated that RACK1-p.L206P mutant mice displayed classic seizure symptoms, with increased neuronal excitability and a tendency for action potential bursts during initial depolarization, along with more frequent spike discharges. Additionally, excitatory synapse density and size in the hippocampal CA1 region of mutant mice were significantly elevated, accompanied by increased expression of VGLUT1 and PSD95 within microglia. This study offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seizures in the seizures and presents valuable clues for the development of future therapeutic strategies.","CRISPR/Cas9, Microglia, Neuron, RACK1, Seizures, Whole exome sequencing"

STAT3 is a well-known regulator of glioblastoma resistance to temozolomide, suppression of its activity sensitizes cells to the treatment. However, systemic suppression of STAT3 may lead to immune dysregulation, possibly interfering with the antitumor effect. Non-coding RNAs expressed from enhancers (enhancer RNA or eRNA) can guide the direction of various cellular processes by controlling the expression of key genes. In this work, we found eRNA from the STAT3 locus (TMZR1-eRNA) that controls the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide. Knockdown of TMZR1-eRNA decreased STAT3 mRNA and protein expression, resulting in a profound reduction in the abundance of temozolomide-treated cells. Using the reporter assay, we showed that eRNA suppression reduced the activity of STAT3 promoter. Patient glioblastoma cells with higher eRNA expression also showed enhanced sensitivity to temozolomide upon eRNA knockdown. Expression of the eRNA in healthy brain tissue and PBMC was observed at markedly lower levels. Taken together, our results suggest TMZR1-eRNA suppression as a more targeted approach to STAT3 inhibition, potentially with minimal side effects.","Enhancer RNA, Glioblastoma, STAT3, TMZR1-eRNA, Temozolomide"

Besides, therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas have been extensively explored in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, targeting various ocular conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, Usher syndrome, fundus neovascular diseases, glaucoma, and corneal diseases. Recent advancements have demonstrated the technology's potential to restore cellular homeostasis and alleviate disease phenotypes, thereby prompting a variety of clinical trials. To date, active trials include treatments for primary open angle glaucoma with MYOC mutations, refractory herpetic viral keratitis, CEP290-associated inherited retinal degenerations, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and retinitis pigmentosa with RHO mutations. However, challenges remain, primarily concerning off-target effects, immunogenicity, ethical considerations, and regulatory particularity. To reach higher safety and efficiency before truly transitioning from bench to bedside, future research should concentrate on improving the specificity and efficacy of Cas proteins, optimizing delivery vectors, and broadening the applicability of therapeutic targets.

While technically challenging, the most direct means to eradicate latent reservoirs is to destroy the HIV provirus, thus ensuring that HIV virions are not produced while preserving resident cells. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN)─a genome editing method with high DNA targeting efficiency─have been investigated as a potential gene therapy by disrupting the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 genes in HIV target cells or HIV proviral DNA in infected cells. However, the transduction and editing efficiencies are low in primary cells and vary by cell type. Using a nanotechnology platform, which we term nanocapsules, the TALEN protein can be effectively delivered into primary cells and escape from endosome/lysosome sequestration. We report that TALEN nanocapsules can effectively mutagenize the HIV-1 proviral DNA integrated into two primary HIV-1 reservoir cells─T cells and macrophages, such that replication and/or reactivation from latency is aborted.

However, the regulatory mechanism behind anthocyanin biosynthesis in potato tuber flesh remains unclear. In this study, we identified the Pigmented tuber flesh (Pf) locus through a genome-wide association study using 135 diploid potato landraces. Genome editing of two tandem R2R3 MYB transcription factor genes, StMYB200 and StMYB210, within the Pf locus demonstrated that both genes are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in tuber flesh. Molecular and biochemical assays revealed that StMYB200 promotes StMYB210 transcription by directly binding to a 1.7-kb insertion present in the StMYB210 promoter, while StMYB210 also regulates its own expression. Furthermore, StMYB200 and StMYB210 both activated the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene StbHLH1 and interacted with StbHLH1 to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. An analysis of the StMYB210 promoter in different diploid potato accessions showed that the 1.7-kb insertion is associated with flesh colour in potato.

In Japan, summer-to-autumn-flowering cultivars (SA-cvs.) flower from July to September. Little research has been conducted to understand why SA-cvs. bloom earlier than autumn-flowering cultivars (A-cvs.). We conducted a comparative study of the relationship between the photoperiodic response of flowering and the gene expression of florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T-like 3 (FTL3) and antiflorigen anti-florigenic FT/TFL1 (AFT). SA-cvs. had a longer critical day length than A-cvs. However, in both groups, a decrease in AFT and increase in FTL3 were consistently observed below the critical day length when flowering was promoted. The opposite responses (less flowering, low FTL3, and high AFT) were observed for longer than the critical day lengths. This indicated that flowering in SA-cvs. was controlled by the regulation of AFT/FTL3 expression, similar to that in A-cvs. Next, we studied the mechanism that causes a variation in critical day lengths. In SA-cvs., the photosensitive phase, which occurs at night, occurs earlier than that in A-cvs. This indicates a variation in the endogenous time-keeping mechanism. This was supported by the fact that the circadian rhythmicity of leaf movement was weaker in SA-cvs. than that in A-cvs. Thus, variation in the endogenous time-keeping mechanism may cause a longer critical day length and earlier flowering time in SA-cvs.",N/A

Conventionally, these lipids are synthesized through complex, multistep chemical processes that are both time-consuming and require significant engineering. Furthermore, the development of new ionizable lipids is hindered by a limited understanding of the structure-activity relationships essential for effective mRNA delivery. In this work, we have developed a modular platform utilizing the Passerini reaction to rapidly generate large, chemically diverse libraries of biodegradable ionizable lipids. This high-throughput approach enables the systematic exploration of various lipid components-head groups, tails, and spacers-and their impacts on mRNA delivery efficiency. By investigating the hydrogen bonding potential between the lipid's head groups and the mRNA's ribose phosphate complex, we found that optimizing the methylene units between the lipid's head groups and linkages could enhance endosomal escape and, consequently, mRNA delivery efficiencies. Leveraging this insight, our platform has led to the identification of the biodegradable ionizable lipid A4B4-S3, which outperforms the current clinical benchmark, SM-102, in gene editing efficacy in mouse liver following systemic administration and demonstrates the promise for repeat-dose protein replacement treatments. This work not only offers a rapid, scalable method for ionizable lipid synthesis but also deepens our understanding of their structure-activity relationships, paving the way for more effective mRNA therapeutics.","gene editing, ionizable lipid, lipid nanoparticles, mRNA delivery"

To address this gap, we applied CRISPR prime editing to insert recombination handles into repetitive sequences, up to 1697 per cell line, which enables generating large-scale deletions, inversions, translocations, and circular DNA. Recombinase induction produced more than 100 stochastic megabase-sized rearrangements in each cell. We tracked these rearrangements over time to measure selection pressures, finding a preference for shorter variants that avoided essential genes. We characterized 29 clones with multiple rearrangements, finding an impact of deletions on expression of genes in the variant but not on nearby genes.

The CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation at HBB is the most prevalent pathogenic mutation of β-thalassemia in both China and Southeast Asia. Previous studies focused on repairing the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation in β-thalassemia patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells, which were subsequently differentiated into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation. In this study, we directly applied the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy to correct the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation in patient-derived HSPCs. The effective editing induced by Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) was confirmed in HUDEP-2 cell lines harboring the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation. Further correction of heterozygote and homozygote HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutations in patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a 13.4-40.8% increase in the proportion of HBB-expressing (HBB +) cells following erythroid differentiation in vitro. At 16 weeks post-xenotransplantation of the edited HSPCs into coisogenic immunodeficient mice, the reparation efficiency in engrafted bone marrow was 17.21% ± 3.66%. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of the engrafted bone marrow showed an increase in the percentage of HBB + cells without impairing the ability of engraftment, self-renewal, and multilineage hematopoietic repopulation of HSPCs. For the safety evaluation, 103 potential off-target sites were predicted by SITE-seq and CRISPOR, with one site displaying significant off-target editing. Since this off-target site is located in the intergenic region, it is presumed to pose minimal risk. Taken together, our study provides critical preclinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy approach for HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation.","HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT), CRISPR/Cas9, Gene editing therapy, Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, β-thalassemia"

This remarkable crop, one of the earliest crops domesticated by humans, offers high biomass and stress-specific properties that render it suitable for a variety of uses including food, feed, bioenergy, and biomaterials. What's truly exciting is the extensive phenotypic variation in sorghum, particularly in traits related to growth, development, and stress resistance. This inherent adaptability makes sorghum a game-changer in agriculture. However, tapping into sorghum's full potential requires unraveling the complex genetic networks that govern its key agricultural traits. Understanding these genetic mechanisms is paramount for improving traits such as yield, quality, and tolerance to drought and saline-alkaline conditions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of functionally characterized genes and regulatory networks associated with plant and panicle architectures, as well as stress resistance in sorghum. Armed with this knowledge, we can develop more resilient and productive sorghum varieties through cutting-edge breeding techniques like genome-wide selection, gene editing, and synthetic biology.

However, isolating independent mutant alleles to molecularly identify causal genes is challenging in species recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. Here, we demonstrate that classic seed EMS mutagenesis coupled with genome sequencing can overcome this limitation in sorghum. We used this method to generate new mutant alleles of sorghum MALE STERILE 8 (MS8) and identified the causal locus for the ms8 phenotype as Sobic.004G270900, which encodes the sorghum ortholog of maize bhlh122, a bHLH transcription factor required for male fertility in maize. Bulked segregant analysis mapped ms8-1 to a region on chromosome 4 containing Sobic.004G270900. Seeds from heterozygous MS8/ms8-1 plants were mutagenized and screened for chimeric inflorescences containing sectors with white, sterile anthers resembling the ms8-1 homozygous phenotype. DNA sequencing of sterile and fertile sectors from a single chimeric inflorescence revealed two mutations in Sobic.004G270900 within the sterile sector, but not the fertile sector. Isolation of this loss-of-function allele (ms8-2) established Sobic.004G270900 as the causative locus for male sterility in the ms8 mutant. We generated additional alleles of MS8 in a different genetic background using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, where deletions in Sobic.004G270900 also resulted in male sterility. Our work identified a gene underlying male sterility in sorghum and provides a novel and straightforward genetic tool for researchers who lack access to advanced transformation facilities to validate gene candidates.

The grain size in cereals is one of the component traits contributing to yield. Previous studies showed that loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in GS3, encoding Gγ subunit of the multimeric G protein complex, increase grain size and weight in rice. While an association between allelic variation in the GS3 homologs of wheat and grain weight/size has been detected previously, the effects of LOF alleles at TaGS3 on these traits remain unknown. We used genome editing to create TaGS3 mutant lines with varying LOF homeo-allele dosages. Contrary to the results obtained in rice, editing all three TaGS3 homoeologous copies resulted in a significant decrease in grain length (4.4%), width (3.4%), grain area (7.3%) and weight (7.5%), without affecting the number of grains per spike. Compared to the wild type, the highest increase in grain weight (up to 9.6%) and area (up to 5.0%) was observed in homozygous mutants with one or two genomes carrying LOF homeo-alleles, suggesting non-additive suppressive effects of TaGS3 on grain size and weight in wheat.

We demonstrated that activation of the glucocorticoid pathway significantly increased the systemic delivery of LNP-mRNA in both mice and monkeys, achieving up to a fourfold improvement. This enhancement was primarily attributed to the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis in circulation and the liver, which resulted in higher LNP accumulation in hepatocytes. Consequently, glucocorticoid activation improved the therapeutic efficacy of LNP-based protein replacement and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing therapies.

This raises ethical concerns that make the development of prenatal gene editing especially challenging. To date, there are no frameworks for considering the steps necessary for an ethical path forward for prenatal gene editing specifically. The 60-year history of in utero therapy has included the development of frameworks for other therapies that can provide starting points for addressing the unique issues of prenatal gene editing.

To overcome this limitation, a protocol for triparental conjugation was established that enables the reliable transfer of vectors for markerless chromosomal modification into C. cellulovorans. The availability of reporter genes is another requirement for strain engineering and biotechnological applications. In this work, the oxygen-free fluorescence absorption-shift tag (FAST) system was used to characterize promoter strength in C. cellulovorans. Selected promoters were used to establish a CRISPR/Cas system for markerless chromosomal modifications. For stringent control of expression of Cas9, a theophylline-dependent riboswitch was used, and additionally, the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4 was used to reduce the basal activity of the Cas9 in the off-state of the riboswitch. Finally, the newly established CRISPR/Cas system was used for the markerless deletion of the genes encoding two restriction endonucleases of a type II restriction-modification (RS) system from the chromosome of C. cellulovorans. In comparison to the WT, the conjugation efficiency when using the deletion mutant as the recipient strain was improved by about one order of magnitude, without the need for prior C. cellulovorans-specific in vivo methylation of the conjugative plasmid in the E. coli donor strain.

Then, The patient remained in complete remission (CR) for four months before a relapse with 26.64% chimerism rate, so he was treated with allogeneic anti-CD7 CAR-T cells after chemotherapy reducing the tumor burden. The CAR-T product was a novel anti-CD7 CAR-T based on retroviral vectors (RV). After infusion, the patient achieved CR within 1 month after anti-CD7 CAR-T infusion and the remission has been ongoing for 9 months to date. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 1 was experienced while no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was found. In addition, CAR copy number peaked at 350, 758 copies/μg on day 6. This case report of clinical treatment of T-ALL with anti-CD7 CAR-T cells prepared using a retroviral vector without gene editing and combined with chemotherapy, which demonstrated that the RV-based anti-CD7 CAR-T cells had good therapeutic effect and high safety in triple-refractory T-ALL patients.","CD7 CAR-T, T-ALL, chemotherapy, complete remission, retroviral vectors"

This strategy has evolved methodologically due to advances in cloning approaches, modeling/algorithms in short hairpin RNA (shRNA) design for knockdown efficiency, and biochemical modifications in RNA synthesis, among other developments. Overall, these modifications have improved the ways to either reduce or induce the expression of a given gene with efficiency and facility for implementation in the lab. Allied with that, the existence of various human cell line models for cancer covering different histotypes and biological behaviors, especially for thyroid cancer, has helped improve the understanding of cancer biology. In this review, we cover the most frequently used current techniques for gene modulation in the thyroid cancer field, such as RNA interference (RNAi), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 for inhibiting a target gene, and strategies to overexpress a gene, such as plasmid cloning and CRISPRa. Exploring the possibilities for gene modulation allows the improvement of the scientific quality of the studies and the integration of clinicians and basic scientists, leading to better development of translational research.","CRISPR/Cas9, RNA interference, microRNA, thyroid cancer"

YerA from Bacillus subtilis is considered a novel class of enzymes that are capable of catalyzing the deamination of 6mA to produce hypoxanthine. Despite the significance of this type of enzymes in bacterial self-defense system and potential applications as a gene-editing tool, the substrate specificity, catalytic mechanism, and physiological function of YerA are currently unclear due to the lack of structural information. In the present study, we expressed the recombinant enzyme and conducted its reconstitution to yield the active form. Our deamination assays showed that N6-methyladenosine (N6-mAdo) served as a more favorable substrate than its base derivative 6mA. Here, we report the high-resolution structure of the C-terminal region of YerA, which exhibited a compact architecture composed of two antiparallel β-sheets with no obvious close structural homologs in Protein Data Bank. We also created docking models to investigate the ligand-binding pattern and found that more favorable contacts of N6-mAdo with the enzyme-binding pocket lead to its preference for N6-mAdo over 6mA. Finally, structural comparison of the N6-methyladenosine monophosphate deaminase allowed us to propose that a plausible role for this C-terminal region is to shield the active site from solvent and protect the intermediate during catalysis. Taken together, this study sheds light on the catalytic mechanism and evolutionary pathways of the promiscuous enzyme YerA, thereby contributing to our molecular understanding of epigenetic nucleoside metabolism.","N6-methyladenosine, catalytic mechanism, deaminase, molecular docking, substrate specificity"

However, both in nature and in cultivation, cyanobacteria go through different abiotic stresses such as high light (HL) stress, heavy metal stress, nutrient limitation, heat stress, salt stress, oxidative stress, and alcohol stress. In recent years, significant improvement has been made in identifying the stress-responsive genes and the linked pathways in cyanobacteria and developing genome editing tools for their manipulation. Metabolic pathways play an important role in stress tolerance; their modification is also a very promising approach to adapting to stress conditions. Several synthetic as well as systems biology approaches have been developed to identify and manipulate genes regulating cellular responses under different stresses. In this review, we summarize the impact of different stresses on metabolic processes, the small RNAs, genes and heat shock proteins (HSPs) involved, changes in the metabolome and their adaptive mechanisms. The developing knowledge of the adaptive behaviour of cyanobacteria may also be utilised to develop better stress-responsive strains for various applications.","Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), Carbon sink, Cyanobacteria, Heat shock proteins, Sigma factors, Stress tolerance"

To expand on this application, we investigated LNP-mediated mRNA delivery to the anterior chamber of the eye via the intracameral (IC) route of administration. Here, we show that IC injections of LNPs facilitated protein expression and gene editing in the trabecular meshwork (TM). Administration of Cre-mRNA LNPs to Ai9 mice resulted in robust tdTomato expression in the angle and corneal endothelium. In C57BL/6 mice, mCherry-mRNA LNPs demonstrated localized protein expression in the TM, which peaked at 72 h and subsequently declined over 120 h. Additionally, LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA with sgAi9 enabled in vivo gene editing in Ai9 mice, with up to 14.3 % editing efficiency. This induced tdTomato expression in the iridocorneal angle, validating the potential of LNPs for gene editing applications. Importantly, no ocular toxicity was observed, indicating the safety of the IC LNP administration.

With the increasing incidence of PD, it is particularly important to explore its pathology and provide effective interventions and treatments. The pathogenesis of PD involves a variety of factors such as genetics, environment, and age, and is not yet fully understood. The main pathogenic mechanisms include neuronal degeneration, abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein, formation of Lewy bodies and oxidative stress, etc. In recent years, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, and immunotherapy, along with traditional drugs and surgical treatments, have become widely used. Currently, all treatments for PD are symptomatic and there is no radical cure. This paper reviews existing traditional and emerging treatments for PD to provide a theoretical basis for the in-depth study of PD pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Meanwhile, the application of gene editing and delivery, stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy and multi-target therapy laid the foundation for the development of safer, more effective and more comprehensive treatments for PD.","Gene therapy, Immunotherapy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Pathogenic mechanisms, Stem cell therapy"

CRISPR/Cas12i3, which belongs to the Class II Type V-I Cas system, has attracted extensive attention recently due to its smaller protein size and less restricted canonical ""TTN"" protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). However, due to its relatively lower editing efficiency, Cas12i3-mediated multiplex gene editing has not yet been documented in plants. Here, we fused four 5' exonucleases (Exo) including T5E, UL12, PapE, ME15 to the N terminal of an optimized Cas12i3 variant (Cas12i3-5M), respectively, and systematically evaluated the editing activities of these Exo:Cas12i3-5M fusions across six endogenous targets in rice stable lines. We demonstrated that the Exo:Cas12i3-5M fusions increased the gene editing efficiencies by up to 12.46-fold and 1.25-fold compared with Cas12i3 and Cas12i3-5M, respectively. Notably, the UL12:Cas12i3-5M fusion enabled robust single gene editing with editing efficiencies of up to 90.42%-98.61% across the six tested endogenous genes. We further demonstrated that, although all the Exo:Cas12i5-5M fusions were capable of multiplex gene editing, UL12:Cas12i3-5M exhibited a superior performance in the simultaneous editing of three, four, five or six genes with efficiencies of 82.76%, 61.36%, 52.94%, and 51.06% in rice stable lines, respectively. Together, we evaluated different Exo:Cas12i3-5M fusions systemically and established UL12:Cas12i3-5M as the more robust system for single and multiplex gene editing in rice. The development of an alternative robust single and multiplex gene editing system will enrich plant genome editing toolkits and facilitate pyramiding of agronomically important traits for crop improvement.","Cas12i3‐5M, exonucleases, multiplex gene editing, rice (Oryza sativa L.)"

Our results suggested that one of the genes is predominant in the soyasaponin biosynthesis. Soyasaponins, which are triterpenoid saponins contained in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merril], are responsible for the astringent aftertaste of soyfood, and their complete elimination from soybean seeds is a key challenge in the development of cultivars with improved taste. While the loss of function in the ß-amyrin synthase genes (GmBAS1 and GmBAS2) has proven effective in reducing soyasaponin content in soybean seeds, the specific functional roles of these genes remain unclear. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on two GmBAS loci using a DNA-free clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 (Cas9) system. A complex of sgRNA targeting sequences conserved in the two loci and Cas9 protein was introduced into the shoot apical meristems of soybean embryonic axes via bombardment. Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) analysis conducted 1 month post-bombardment revealed that 138 seedlings out of 1,467 screened exhibited mutations at one or both GmBAS loci. CAPS and sequencing analysis in the subsequent generation identified a total of 16 plants with inheritable mutations ranging from one to ten nucleotides. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that site-directed mutagenesis in the GmBAS1 locus resulted in the absence of soyasaponins in mature seeds, as well as in young roots, stems, and leaves. These findings demonstrate that GmBAS1 is the predominant ß-amyrin synthase gene in soybean plants. In addition, the DNA-free CRISPR/Cas9 system was shown to be highly efficient in inducing simultaneous mutagenesis at two target loci using a single gRNA.","Glycine max, Particle-bombardment, Ribonucleoprotein, Shoot apical meristem, Soyasaponins, ß-amyrin synthase"
39872718,Mouse Model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Pulpitis.,Bio-protocol,2025,"Lanting Shao, Baian Chen, Ying Zheng","Pulpitis is an important and prevalent disease within the oral cavity. Thus, animal models are necessary tools for basic research focused on pulpitis. Researchers worldwide often use dogs and miniature pigs to construct animal models of pulpitis. However, gene editing in miniature pigs is difficult, the surgical modeling process is complex, and tooth demineralization time is lengthy. Although some researchers have attempted to establish a mouse model of pulpitis, most models have involved direct exposure of dental pulp. However, the causes of pulpitis vary considerably among individuals, hindering effective research. In this study, we established a mouse model of pulpitis by accessing the pulp cavity, exposing the pulp to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then filling the tooth. One day after surgery, we observed many necrotic tissues and extensive inflammatory exudate, including neutrophils, around the coronal cavity preparation. Additionally, we noted many more neutrophils and a small amount of chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates at the junction between inflamed and normal tissue. These findings indicated that our model can be used to explore the early stage of pulpitis. Ten days after surgery, we observed vacuolar degeneration in some fibroblasts and proliferation in others at the distal end of the inflamed tissue. We also noted dilation and congestion of the pulp blood vessels. Therefore, our model can also be used to explore the middle and later stages of pulpitis. Thirty days after surgery, we observed necrosis in the coronal pulp cavity and upper half of the root pulp, indicating that our model can also be used to explore the end stage of pulpitis. This model is easy to establish, shows pulpitis progression in the dental pulp, exhibits a clear inflammatory phenotype, and can be readily combined with gene editing techniques. Accordingly, it is suitable for basic research focused on pulpitis and has substantial practical value. Key features • Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce pulpitis in mice. • The mouse model of LPS-induced pulpitis can be used in basic studies of pulpitis. • After 1 day, the mouse model of LPS-induced pulpitis can demonstrate the main phenotypes of early-stage pulpitis. • After 10 days, the mouse model of LPS-induced pulpitis can display the main phenotypes of middle and late stage pulpitis.

Despite initial challenges, including hyperacute rejection resulting from natural (preformed) antibody binding and complement activation, significant progress has been made through gene editing of the organ-source pigs and refinement of immunosuppressive regimens. Major steps were the identification and deletion of expression of the three known glycan xenoantigens on pig vascular endothelial cells, the transgenic expression of human ""protective"" proteins, e.g., complement-regulatory, coagulation-regulatory, and anti-inflammatory proteins, and the administration of an immunosuppressive regimen based on blockade of the CD40/CD154 T cell co-stimulation pathway. Efforts to address systemic inflammation followed. The synergy between gene editing and judicious immunomodulation appears to largely prevent graft rejection and is associated with a relatively good safety profile. Though there remains an incidence of severe or persistent proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) in a minority of cases. This progress offers renewed hope for patients in need of life-saving organ transplants.","immunosuppression, non-human primate, swine, transplantation immunology, xenotransplantation"

This review highlights innovative therapeutic strategies, including gene replacement, gene silencing, oncolytic virotherapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, with a focus on their application in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool in precision medicine, enables precise editing of cancer-driving mutations, enhancing immune responses and disrupting tumor growth mechanisms. Additionally, emerging approaches target ferroptosis-a regulated, iron-dependent form of cell death-offering new possibilities for selectively inducing tumor cell death in resistant cancers. Despite significant breakthroughs, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remain. To overcome these barriers, novel approaches like dual-targeting, armored CAR-T cells, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers are being explored. Additionally, the rise of allogeneic ""off-the-shelf"" CAR-T therapies offers scalable and more accessible treatment options. The regulatory landscape is evolving to accommodate these advancements, with frameworks like RMAT (Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy) in the U.S. and ATMP (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) in Europe fast-tracking the approval of gene therapies. However, ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR-based gene editing-such as off-target effects, germline editing, and ensuring equitable access-remain at the forefront, requiring ongoing ethical oversight. Advances in non-viral delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and exosomes, are improving the safety and efficacy of gene therapies.

Given that this modification impacts global gene expression, RNA localization, and innate cellular immunity, dysregulation of A-to-I editing has unsurprisingly been linked to a variety of cancers and other diseases. However, our current understanding of the underpinning mechanisms that connect dysregulated A-to-I editing and disease processes remains limited. Widely used methods require RNA extraction and pooling that ultimately erases subcellular localization and cell-to-cell variation, which may be critical to understanding misregulation. To overcome these challenges, we recently developed Endonuclease V Immunostaining Assay (EndoVIA) to selectively detect and visualize A-to-I edited RNA in situ. In this chapter, we describe in detail how to prepare cell samples, stain A-to-I edited transcripts with EndoVIA, quantify global inosine abundance, and visualize the subcellular localization of inosine-containing RNAs at the single molecule level.","A-to-I editing, Imaging, Immunofluorescence, Localization, Microscopy"
39870450,Obstacles in quantifying A-to-I RNA editing by Sanger sequencing.,Methods in enzymology,2025,"Alla Fishman, Ayelet T Lamm","Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most prevalent type of RNA editing, in which adenosine within a completely or largely double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is converted to inosine by deamination. RNA editing was shown to be involved in many neurological diseases and cancer; therefore, detection of A-to-I RNA editing and quantitation of editing levels are necessary for both basic and clinical biomedical research. While high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is widely used for global detection of editing events, Sanger sequencing is the method of choice for precise characterization of editing site clusters (hyper-editing) and for comparing levels of editing at a particular site under different environmental conditions, developmental stages, genetic backgrounds, or disease states. To detect A-to-I editing events and quantify them using Sanger sequencing, RNA samples are reverse transcribed, cDNA is amplified using gene-specific primers, and then sequenced. The chromatogram outputs are then compared to the genomic DNA sequence. As editing occurs in the context of dsRNA, the reverse transcription step is performed at a temperature as high as 65 °C, using thermostable reverse transcriptase to open double-stranded structures. However, this measure alone is insufficient for transcripts possessing long stems comprised of hundreds of nucleotide pairs. Consequently, the editing levels detected by Sanger sequencing are significantly lower than those obtained by HTS, and the amplification yield is low. We suggest that the reverse transcription is biased towards unedited transcripts, and the severity of the bias is dependent on the transcript's secondary structure. Here, we show how this bias can be significantly reduced to allow reliable detection of editing levels and sufficient product yield.","A-to-I RNA editing, Sanger Sequencing, ds stem, high folding energy, melting, secondary structure"

RNA editing mediated by human ADAR proteins offers unique advantages, including high specificity and low immunogenicity. Compared to CRISPR-based gene editing techniques, RNA editing events are temporary, which can reduce the risk of long-term unintended side effects, making off-target edits less concerning than DNA-targeting methods. Moreover, ADAR-based RNA editing tools are less likely to elicit immune reactions because ADAR proteins are of human origin, and their small size makes them relatively easy to incorporate into gene therapy vectors, such as adeno-associated virus vectors (AAVs), which have limited space. Despite the promise of RNA editing as a therapeutic approach, precise temporal and spatial control of RNA editing is still lacking. Therefore, we have developed a small molecule-inducible RNA editing strategy by incorporating aptazymes into the guide RNA of the BoxB-λN-ADAR system. This chapter provides detailed protocols for targeted RNA editing by ADAR deaminases using aptazyme-based guide RNAs controlled by exogenous small molecules, marking the earliest use of aptazymes to regulate RNA editing strategies. Once small molecules are added or removed, aptazymes trigger self-cleavage to release the guide RNA, thus achieving small molecule-controlled RNA editing. To satisfy different RNA editing applications, we have realized the conditional activation and deactivation of A-to-I RNA editing of target mRNA using switch aptazymes. We provide step-by-step protocols for constructing guide RNA plasmids for regulatory purposes and conducting small molecule-induced RNA regulatory editing experiments in cells.","ADAR, Aptazymes, RNA editing, Regulatory, Small molecules"

Gene therapy, for common genetic illnesses is becoming more popular and, although viable treatments for genetic disorders are scarce, stop codon mutation-related conditions may benefit from gene editing. Effective SDRE generally depends on introducing many guideRNA molecules relative to the target gene; however, large ratios cannot be achieved in the context of gene therapy applications. Gene-encoded information can be altered, and functionally diverse proteins produced from a single gene by restoration of point-mutated RNA molecules using SDRE. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) is an RNA-editing enzyme, that can specifically convert adenosine (A) residues to inosines (I), which are translated as guanosine (G). MS2 system along with ADAR1 deaminase domain can target a particular A and repair G to A mutations. In this study, we used the RNA binding MS2 coat protein fused with the ADAR1 deaminase domain controlled by the CMV promoter, and a 19 bp guide RNA (complementary to the target mRNA sequence) engineered with 6 × MS2 stem-loops downstream or 1 × MS2 stem-loop (double MS2) on either side, controlled by the U6 promoter. When the EGFP TGG codon (tryptophan) was altered to an amber (TAG), opal (TGA), or ochre (TAA) stop codon, the modified ADAR1 deaminase domain could convert A-to-I (G) at the edited sites. It is anticipated that successful establishment of this technique will result in a new era in gene therapy, allowing remarkably efficient gene repair, even in vivo.","ADAR1, Coat protein, MS2-system, RNA editing, SDRE, Stem loop, Stop codon"

Thus, methods that can sense and respond to RNA profiles in living cells will have broad applications in biology and medicine. CellREADR - Cell access through RNA sensing by Endogenous ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is a programmable RNA sensor-actuator technology that couples the detection of a cell-defining RNA to the translation of an effector protein to monitor and manipulate the cell. The CellREADR RNA device consists of a 5' sensor region complementary to a cellular RNA and a 3' protein payload coding region. Payload translation is gated by the removal of a STOP codon in the sensor region upon base pairing with the cognate cellular RNA through an ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing mechanism ubiquitous to metazoan cells. CellREADR thus represents a new generation of programmable RNA device for monitoring and manipulating animal cells in ways that are simple, versatile, and generalizable across tissues and species. Here, we describe a detailed procedure for implementing CellREADR experiments in cell culture systems and in animals. The procedure includes sensor and payload design, cloning, validation and characterization in mammalian cell cultures. The in vivo protocol focuses on AAV-based delivery of CellREADR through expression vectors using brain tissue as an example. We describe current best practices and various experimental controls.","ADAR, Cell type, Programmable, RNA actuator, RNA editing, RNA sensor"
39870444,Nanopore sequencing to detect A-to-I editing sites.,Methods in enzymology,2025,"Jia Wei Joel Heng, Meng How Tan","Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, mediated by the ADAR family of enzymes, is pervasive in metazoans and functions as an important mechanism to diversify the proteome and control gene expression. Over the years, there have been multiple efforts to comprehensively map the editing landscape in different organisms and in different disease states. As inosine (I) is recognized largely as guanosine (G) by cellular machineries including the reverse transcriptase, editing sites can be detected as A-to-G changes during sequencing of complementary DNA (cDNA). However, such an approach is indirect and can be confounded by genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA mutations. Moreover, past studies rely primarily on the Illumina platform, which generates short sequencing reads that can be challenging to map. Recently, nanopore direct RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful technology to address the issues. Here, we describe the use of the technology together with deep learning models that we have developed, named Dinopore (Detection of inosine with nanopore sequencing), to interrogate the A-to-I editome of any organism.","Deep learning, Direct RNA sequencing, Inosine, Nanopore sequencing, RNA editing, RNA modifications"

As ADARs are endogenously expressed in humans, their editing capacities hold therapeutic potential and allow us to target disease-relevant sequences in RNA through the rationale design of guide RNAs. However, current design principles are not suitable for difficult-to-edit target sites, posing challenges to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of this approach. This chapter discusses how we circumvent this barrier through an in vitro screening method, En Masse Evaluation of RNA Guides (EMERGe), which enables comprehensive screening of ADAR substrate libraries and facilitates the identification of editing-enabling guide strands for specific adenosines. From library generation and screening to next generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis to verification experiments, we describe how a sequence of interest can be identified through this high-throughput screening method. Furthermore, we discuss downstream applications of selected guide sequences, challenges in maximizing library coverage, and potential to couple the screen with machine learning or deep learning models.","ADAR, High-throughput screening, Next-generation sequencing, RNA-editing"

The maize endosperm, a large storage organ, accounting for nearly 90% of the dry weight of mature kernel, serves as the main place for starch storage. In this study, we identify an endosperm-specific EREB gene, ZmEREB167, which encodes a nucleus-localized EREB protein. Knockout of ZmEREB167 significantly increases kernel size and weight, as well as starch and protein content, compared with the wild type. In situ hybridization experiments show that ZmEREB167 is highly expressed in the BETL as well as PED regions of maize kernels. Dual-luciferase assays show that ZmEREB167 exhibits transcriptionally repressor activity in maize protoplasts. Transcriptome analysis reveals that a large number of genes are up-regulated in the Zmereb167-C1 mutant compared with the wild type, including key genetic factors such as ZmMRP-1 and ZmMN1, as well as multiple transporters involved in maize endosperm development. Integration of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results identify 68 target genes modulated by ZmEREB167. We find that ZmEREB167 directly targets OPAQUE2, ZmNRT1.1, ZmIAA12, ZmIAA19, and ZmbZIP20, repressing their expressions. Our study demonstrates that ZmEREB167 functions as a negative regulator in maize endosperm development and affects starch accumulation and kernel size.","BETL, EREB protein, Kernel development, Maize, Starch"

Here, we identified and characterized the PagHCF106 gene of poplar (Populus alba × Populus glandulosa). The PagHCF106 protein localized predominantly to the chloroplast and the PagHCF106 gene exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern. Overexpression of PagHCF106 rescued the reduced stomatal aperture and increased drought resistance of the hcf106 Arabidopsis mutant. Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated genome editing introduced mutations in the core region of the PagHCF106 promoter, which was required for its activity, as confirmed by the GUS staining assay. Mutation of the PagHCF106 promoter reduced stomatal opening and water loss in poplar. In addition, the genome-edited poplar lines accumulated high levels of hydrogen peroxide in guard cells. Taken together, these results suggest that PagHCF106 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance by modulating stomatal aperture, which might be associated with reactive oxygen species production. We propose that modification of the PagHCF106 promoter might be an efficient strategy for enhancing drought stress tolerance in poplar.","ROS, chloroplast protein, drought tolerance, promoter editing, stomatal movement"

In vitro studies have shown that removing the regulatory domain abolishes the feedback regulation on plant IPMS while retaining its catalytic activity. However, the physiological consequences and underlying molecular regulation of Leu flux upon removing the IPMS regulatory domain remain to be explored in plants. Here, we removed the IPMS C-terminal regulatory domain using a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system and studied the resulting impact on the Leu biosynthesis pathway under in planta conditions. Absence of the IPMS regulatory domain unexpectedly reduced the formation of the end product Leu but increased the levels of Leu pathway intermediates in mustard (Brassica juncea). Additionally, delayed growth was observed when IPMS devoid of the regulatory domain was introduced into IPMS-null mutants of Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana. Further, a detailed biochemical analysis showed that in the absence of the C-terminal regulatory domain, a Leu pathway intermediate (α-ketoisocaproate) could compete with the native IPMS substrate (2-oxoisovalerate) for the active site. Combining these metabolomic, biochemical, and in planta analyses, we demonstrate that the C-terminal regulatory domain of IPMS is critical for maintaining Leu-Val homeostasis in plants.",N/A

Here, we discovered that although the top loop of the 5' handle of guide RNA can undergo central splitting, deactivating CRISPR-Cas12a, the segments can dramatically restore CRISPR function through nucleic acid self-assembly or interactions with small molecules and aptamers. This discovery forms the basis of an engineered Cas12a system with a programmable proximity-activated guide RNA (PARC-Cas12a) that links targets of interest to dsDNA.

To better understand the contribution of tumor genotype to immunosurveillance, we generated and validated lentiviral vectors that create an epi-allelic series of increasingly immunogenic neoantigens. This vector system is compatible with autochthonous Cre-regulated cancer models, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic genome editing, and tumor barcoding. Here, we show that in the context of KRAS-driven lung cancer and strong neoantigen expression, tumor suppressor genotype dictates the degree of immune cell recruitment, positive selection of tumors with neoantigen silencing, and tumor outgrowth. By quantifying the impact of 11 commonly inactivated tumor suppressor genes on tumor growth across neoantigenic contexts, we show that the growth promoting effects of tumor suppressor gene inactivation correlate with increasing sensitivity to immunosurveillance. Importantly, specific genotypes dramatically increase or decrease sensitivity to immunosurveillance independently of their growth promoting effects. We propose a model of immunoediting in which tumor suppressor gene inactivation works in tandem with neoantigen expression to shape tumor immunosurveillance and immunoediting such that the same neoantigens uniquely modulate tumor immunoediting depending on the genetic context.",N/A

Comparative evaluations were conducted using all-in-one and two-vector systems. Genome sequencing and membrane protein productivity of ATF4-knockout (KO) cells were compared to wild-type (WT) cells using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and a membrane protein isolation kit, respectively. Single-cell analysis confirmed gene editing patterns, with NGS verifying the intended deletions. Membrane protein production was also assessed indirectly via flow cytometry, analyzing cells expressing Membrane-GFP. Compared to WT cells, ATF4-KO cells exhibited a significant increase in membrane protein production, with a 52.2 ± 19.0% improvement. Gene editing efficiency was compared between the two delivery systems, with the two-vector system demonstrating higher efficiency based on T7 endonuclease I assays. Western blot analysis confirmed ATF4 suppression and increased expression of membrane proteins, including E-cadherin and CD63. Quantitative analysis via PAGE revealed a 77.2 ± 30.6% increase in purified membrane protein yields, consistent with the observed enhancements.

In recent years, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) have gradually attracted attention because they offer new directions for the treatment of CVDs. Super-enhancer RNAs (seRNAs) are a subset of non-coding RNAs that are transcribed from regions of the genome known as super enhancers, which are large clusters of enhancers with a high density of transcription factors and cofactors. These regions play a pivotal role in regulating genes involved in cell identity and disease progression. This article reviews the characteristics of seRNAs, their expression patterns, and regulatory mechanisms in the cardiovascular system. We also explore their role in the occurrence and development of CVDs, as well as their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Currently, therapies targeting seRNAs are a research hotspot. The development of specific inhibitors or activators is expected to facilitate precise interventions for CVDs. In addition, the use of gene editing techniques to modify relevant eRNA introduces new possibilities for disease treatment.

Autopolyploids have been comparatively less studied than allopolyploids, with sexual autopolyploidization receiving even less attention. In this work, we studied the transcriptomes of neotetraploids (2n = 4x = 32) obtained by crossing two diploid (2n = 2x = 16) plants of Medicago sativa that produce a significant percentage of either 2n eggs or pollen. Diploid progeny from the same cross allowed us to separate the transcriptional outcomes of hybridization from those of WGD. This material can help to elucidate events at the base of the domestication of cultivated 4x alfalfa, the world's most important leguminous forage. Three 2x and three 4x progeny plants and 2x parental plants were used for this study. The RNA-seq data revealed that WGD did not dramatically affect the transcription of leaf protein-coding genes. The two parental genotypes did not contribute equally to the progeny transcriptomes, and genome-wide expression level dominance of the male parent was observed. A large majority of the genes whose expression level changed due to WGD presented increased expression, indicating that the 4x state requires the upregulation of approximately 2.66% of the protein-coding genes. Overall, we estimated that 3.63% of the protein-coding genes were transcriptionally affected by WGD and may contribute to the phenotypic novelty of the neotetraploid plants. Pathway analysis suggested that WGD could affect secondary metabolite biosynthesis, which in turn may influence forage quality. We found four times as many transcription factor genes among the polyploidization-affected genes than among those affected only by hybridization. Several of these belong to classes involved in stress response. Small RNA-seq revealed that very few miRNAs were significantly associated with WGD, but they target several hundred genes, and their role in the WGD response may be relevant. Integrated network analysis led to the identification of putative miRNA: mRNA interactions potentially involved in transcriptome reprogramming. Allele-specific expression analysis indicated that parent-of-origin bias was not a significant outcome of WGD, but we found that parentally biased RNA editing may be a significant source of variation in neopolyploids.","Alfalfa, Expression level dominance, Gene coexpression network, RNA-Seq, Sexual polyploidization, Small RNA, Whole genome duplication"

Biotic stresses, such as pathogens, insects, and pests, severely threaten global food security and crop productivity. Traditional chemical pesticides, while effective, can lead to environmental degradation and increase pest resistance over time. Plant-derived natural products such as secondary metabolites like alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, and phytoalexins offer promising alternatives due to their ability to enhance plant immunity and inhibit pest activity. Recent advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have improved our understanding of how these natural compounds function at the cellular level, activating specific plant defense through complex biochemical pathways regulated by various transcription factors (TFs) such as MYB, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, NAC, and AP2/ERF. Advancements in multi-omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have significantly improved the understanding of the regulatory networks that govern PSM synthesis. These integrative approaches have led to the discovery of novel insights into plant responses to biotic stresses, identifying key regulatory genes and pathways involved in plant defense.

A common feature of neurodegenerative disorders is mitochondrial dysfunction, which affects the brain's sensitivity to oxidative damage and its high oxygen demand. This dysfunction may plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, which leads to the production of a toxic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. This disruption in mitochondrial function compromises energy metabolism and increases oxidative stress, resulting in mitochondrial DNA abnormalities, impaired calcium homeostasis, and altered mitochondrial dynamics. These effects ultimately may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cell death, underscoring the importance of targeting mitochondrial function in developing therapeutic strategies for HD. This review discusses the mechanistic role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Huntington's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial factor in HD, making mitochondrial-targeted therapies a promising approach for treatment. We explore therapies that address bioenergy deficits, antioxidants that reduce reactive oxygen species, calcium modulators that restore calcium homeostasis, and treatments that enhance mitochondrial dynamics to rejuvenate mitochondrial function. We also highlight innovative treatment approaches such as gene editing and stem cell therapy, which offer hope for more personalized strategies.

T. gondii establishes a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) which shields the parasite from the host's intracellular defense mechanisms. Murine GBPs (mGBPs) recognize T. gondii PVs and assemble into supramolecular mGBP homo- and heterocomplexes that are required for the disruption of the membrane of PVs eventually resulting in the cell-autonomous immune control of vacuole-resident pathogens. We have previously shown that mGBP2 plays an important role in T. gondii immune control. Here, to unravel mGBP2 functions, we report Galectin-9 (Gal9) as a critical mGBP2 interaction partner engaged for immunity to T. gondii. Interestingly, Gal9 also accumulates and colocalizes with mGBP2 at the T. gondii PV.

Such peptide hormones are encoded by nuclear genes, and often go through proteolytic processing of preproproteins and post-translational modifications. Most peptide hormones are secreted out of the cell to interact with membrane-associated receptors in neighboring cells, and subsequently activate signal transductions, leading to changes in gene expression and cellular responses. Since the discovery of the first plant peptide hormone, systemin, in tomato in 1991, putative peptide hormones have continuously been identified in different plant species, showing their importance in both short- and long-range signal transductions. The roles of peptide hormones are implicated in, but not limited to, processes such as self-incompatibility, pollination, fertilization, embryogenesis, endosperm development, stem cell regulation, plant architecture, tissue differentiation, organogenesis, dehiscence, senescence, plant-pathogen and plant-insect interactions, and stress responses.

The parasite has a highly adaptable life cycle comprising successive rounds of asexual replication in a vertebrate host and sexual maturation in the mosquito vector Anopheles. Genetic manipulation of the parasite has been instrumental for deciphering the function of Plasmodium genes. Conventional reverse genetic tools cannot be used to study essential genes of the asexual blood stages, thereby necessitating the development of conditional strategies. Among various such strategies, the rapamycin-inducible dimerisable Cre (DiCre) recombinase system emerged as a powerful approach for conditional editing of essential genes in human-infecting P. falciparum and in the rodent malaria model parasite P. berghei. We previously generated a DiCre-expressing P. berghei line and validated it by conditionally deleting several essential asexual stage genes, revealing their important role also in sporozoites. Another potent tool is the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, which has enabled targeted genome editing with higher accuracy and specificity and greatly advanced genome engineering in Plasmodium spp. Here, we developed new P. berghei parasite lines by integrating the DiCre cassette and a fluorescent marker in parasites constitutively expressing Cas9. Owing to the dual integration of CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre, these new lines allow unparalleled levels of gene modification and conditional regulation simultaneously. To illustrate the versatility of this new tool, we conditionally knocked out the essential gene encoding the claudin-like apicomplexan micronemal protein (CLAMP) in P. berghei and confirmed the role of CLAMP during invasion of erythrocytes.","Plasmodium, CRISPR, Conditional mutagenesis, Malaria"

The production of their semi-synthetic precursors relies solely on microbial metabolism, leading to elevated production costs. Anidulafungin, an excellent echinocandin drug, is derived from echinocandin B (ECB), which is industrially produced by Aspergillus pachycristatus. However, the genes involved in the actual ECB biosynthesis remain unclear, which hinders yield improvements through engineered strains. This study systematically investigated the putative ECB biosynthetic gene cluster using genomic and transcriptomic profiling combined with gene editing. Among the 18 putative genes previously reported, only a 13-gene cluster (ecdA, ecdG-J, htyA-F) was found to be actively involved in ECB biosynthesis, while the remaining 5 genes (ecdB-F) were non-essential and functioned independently. Notably, we identified that htyC and htyD were involved in L-homotyrosine biosynthesis, while HtyF catalyzed the C4 hydroxylation of 3S-hydroxyl-L-homotyrosine. Most importantly, EcdJ was identified as a crucial global transcriptional activator regulating the ECB gene cluster. Deletion of ecdJ silenced all related genes and abolished ECB production. Accordingly, overexpressing ecdJ alone or combining ecdA and htyF together significantly enhanced ECB yield. Under optimized liquid fermentation conditions, ECB production in the OEecdJ strain achieved 841 ± 23.11 mg/L. Solid-state fermentation further enhanced the ECB yield to 1.5 g/L, which is 7.7-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain under initial liquid fermentation conditions. This study has thoroughly elucidated the functions of key genes involved in the ECB biosynthesis and provided effective strategies for enhancing antifungal prodrug-ECB production, achieving the highest ECB production in an engineering A. pachycristatus strain.","Anidulafungin, Antifungal drug, Aspergillus pachycristatus, Echinocandin B, Transcriptional activator"

With the increasing demand in medical research and agricultural markets, more and more application scenarios require gene edited pigs to possess two or even more advantageous phenotypes simultaneously. The current production of multi gene edited pigs is inefficient, time-consuming, and costly, and there is an urgent need to develop efficient and accurate multi gene editing application technologies. The polycistronic tRNA-gRNA-processing system (PTG), developed based on endogenous tRNA self-processing systems, has been shown to exhibit efficient multi gene editing in plants. This study aims to combine a PTG strategy with multiple gRNA production functions with an adenine base editor (ABE) to test its feasibility for efficient and precise multi gene base editing in pig cells. The results indicate that the PTG based integrated ABE plasmid can perform efficient base editing at multiple gene loci in pig cells. And while the gene editing efficiency was significantly improved, no indel and sgRNA dependent off target effects caused by DSB were detected. This work permit will provide a solid foundation for the production of multi gene edited pigs with agricultural and medical applications.","CD163, MSTN, base editing, endogenous tRNA self‐processing system, genetic improvement, pig"

This article reviews the application of gene editing technology in the treatment of breast cancer, and discusses its challenges and future development directions. The key application areas of gene editing technology in the treatment of breast cancer will be outlined, including the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of drugs related to the pathway. Gene editing technology has played an important role in the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Through the use of gene editing technology, breast cancer-related genes are systematically edited to regulate key regulatory factors on related pathways or key tumor suppressor genes such as FOXC1 and BRCA, and the results are analyzed in cell or animal experiments, and the target is obtained from the experimental results, which provides important clues for the development of new drugs. This approach provides an innovative way to find more effective treatment strategies and inhibit tumor growth. In addition, gene editing technology has also promoted the personalization of breast cancer treatment. By analyzing a patient's genomic information, researchers can pinpoint key genetic mutations in a patient's tumor and design personalized treatments. This personalized treatment approach is expected to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce adverse reactions. Finally, the application of gene editing technology also provides support for the development of breast cancer immunotherapy. By editing immune cells to make them more potent against tumors, researchers are trying to develop more effective immunotherapies to bring new treatment options to breast cancer patients.","CRISPR‐CAS, application of gene editing, breast cancer, triple‐negative breast cancer"

They have played a crucial role in biomedical research, complementing studies conducted in mice. The advent of genome editing technologies has facilitated the generation of genetically modified rat strains, advancing studies in experimental animals. Among these innovations, Cre-driver rat models have emerged as powerful tools for spatiotemporal control of gene expression. However, their development and characterization remain less advanced compared to mouse models. In this study, we developed liver-targeting Cre knock-in rats and reporter knock-in rats to evaluate Cre recombinase expression profiles in different genetic contexts. Our results revealed that insertion orientation and promoter origin significantly influence Cre expression patterns. Notably, forward insertion of the Albumin (Alb) promoter-driven Cre sequence at the ROSA26 locus resulted in ubiquitous Cre expression, while reverse insertion confined Cre expression predominantly to the liver. Interestingly, Cre expression under an endogenous Alb promoter unexpectedly induced expression in non-liver tissues, which may suggest a potential link to the in vivo dynamics of albumin. These findings underscore the importance of rigorous characterization in Cre-based transgenic systems. By elucidating the roles of promoter origin, insertion site, and orientation, our study provides valuable insights for optimizing Cre-driver rat models. These findings pave the way for refining genetic strategies to enhance tissue specificity and reliability in functional genomics and disease modeling.","Cre-loxP, genome editing, histology, liver, rats"

While several genetic tools for modifying genes or controlling expression separately are available for Caenorhabditis elegans, there are no genetic approaches to generate mutations that simultaneously disrupt gene function and provide genetic access to the cells expressing the disrupted gene. To achieve this, we developed a versatile gene trap strategy based on cGAL, a GAL4-UAS bipartite expression system for C. elegans. We designed a cGAL gene trap cassette and used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert it into the target gene, creating a bicistronic operon that simultaneously expresses a truncated endogenous protein and the cGAL driver in the cells expressing the target gene. We demonstrate that our cGAL gene trap strategy robustly generated loss-of-function alleles. Combining the cGAL gene trap lines with different UAS effector strains allowed us to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype, observe the gene expression pattern, and manipulate cell activity spatiotemporally. We show that, by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) via microinjection or genetic crossing, the cGAL gene trap lines can be further engineered in vivo to easily swap cGAL with other bipartite expression systems' drivers, including QF/QF2, Tet-On/Tet-Off, and LexA, to generate new gene trap lines with different drivers at the same genomic locus. These drivers can be combined with their corresponding effectors for orthogonal transgenic control. Thus, our cGAL-based gene trap is versatile and represents a powerful genetic tool for gene function analysis in C. elegans, which will ultimately provide new insights into how genes in the genome control the biology of an organism.",N/A

However, this technique is unfavorable for field applications, especially in vegetatively propagated plants, such as many commercial tree species, where the gene-editing cassette cannot be segregated away without breaking the genetic constitution of the elite variety. Here, we describe an efficient method for generating gene-edited Populus tremula × P. alba (poplar) trees without incorporating foreign DNA into its genome. Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we expressed a base-editing construct targeting CCoAOMT1 along with the ALS genes for positive selection on a chlorsulfuron-containing medium. About 50% of the regenerated shoots were derived from transient transformation and were free of T-DNA. Overall, 7% of the chlorsulfuron-resistant shoots were T-DNA free, edited in the CCoAOMT1 gene and nonchimeric. Long-read whole-genome sequencing confirmed the absence of any foreign DNA in the tested gene-edited lines. Additionally, we evaluated the CodA gene as a negative selection marker to eliminate lines that stably incorporated the T-DNA into their genome.

Development of commercial hybrid varieties has proven to be a sustainable and economical alternative to deliver superior yield, quality and resistance with uniformity in a number of food crops. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), a maternally inherited inability to produce functional pollen, facilitates a three-line system for efficient hybrid seed production strategies in crops. The CMS system has illustrated its potential as a robust pollination control mechanism to support the billion-dollar seed industry. In plants, CMS arises due to a genomic conflict between mitochondrial open reading frames (orfs) and nuclear-encoding restoration-of-fertility (Rf) genes, leading to floral abnormalities and pollen sterility. Research on pollen sterility and fertility restoration provides deeper insights into cytoplasmic-nuclear interplay in plants and elucidates key molecular targets for hybrid breeding in crops. More recently, programmable gene editing (e.g., TALEN, CRISPR-Cas) has emerged as a promising tool to functionally validate CMS and Rf genes and obviate the need for pollen donors or Rf-genes for hybrid breeding. Modern genomic prediction models have allowed establishment of high-performing heterotic groups and patterns for sustaining long-term gain in hybrid breeding. This article reviews latest discoveries elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind CMS and fertility restoration in plants. We then present our perspective on how evolving genetic technologies are contributing to advance fundamental knowledge of the CMS-Rf genetic system for producing crop hybrids with high heterosis.","Cytoplasmic male sterility, Fertility restoration, Heterosis, Hybrid vigour, Inheritance, Mitochondria, Seed"

FLT3 is considered an important therapeutic target due to frequent mutation in AML and association with relapse. However, there has been limited clinical success with FLT3 drug targeting, suggesting either that FLT3 is not a vulnerability in LSC, or that more potent inhibition is required, a scenario where HSC toxicity could become limiting. We tested these possibilities by ablating FLT3 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FLT3 knock-out (FLT3-KO) in human LSCs and HSCs followed by functional xenograft assays. FLT3-KO in LSCs from FLT3-ITD mutated, but not FLT3-wild type (WT) AMLs, resulted in short-term leukemic grafts of FLT3-KO edited cells that disappeared by 12 weeks. By contrast, FLT3-KO in HSCs from fetal liver, cord blood and adult bone marrow did not impair multilineage hematopoiesis in primary and secondary xenografts.

Although two genetically linked NLRs function together as an NLR pair have been reported in other species, this phenomenon has been relatively less studied in wheat. Here, we demonstrate that two tightly linked NLR genes, RXL and Pm5e, arranged in a head-to-head orientation, function together as an NLR pair to mediate powdery mildew resistance in wheat. The resistance function of the RXL/Pm5e pair is validated by mutagenesis, gene silencing, and gene-editing assays. Interestingly, both RXL and Pm5e encode atypical NLRs, with RXL possessing a truncated NB-ARC (nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins and CED-4) domain and Pm5e featuring an atypical coiled-coil (CC) domain. Notably, RXL and Pm5e lack an integrated domain associated with effector recognition found in all previously reported NLR pairs. Additionally, RXL and Pm5e exhibit a preference for forming hetero-complexes rather than homo-complexes, highlighting their cooperative role in disease resistance. We further show that the CC domain of Pm5e specifically suppresses the hypersensitive response induced by the CC domain of RXL through competitive interaction, revealing regulatory mechanisms within this NLR pair.

Several cancer-relevant genes occupy this portion of chromosome 11, and it is thought that overexpression of a combination of driver genes in this region is responsible for the poor outcome of women in this group. In this study we used a gene editing method to knock out, one by one, each of 198 genes that are located within the amplified region of chromosome 11 and determined how much each of these genes contributed to the survival of breast cancer cells. In addition to well-known drivers such as CCND1 and PAK1, we identified two different genes (SERPINH1 and P4HA3), that encode proteins involved in collagen synthesis and organization. Using both in vitro and in vivo functional analyses, we determined that P4HA3 and/or SERPINH1 provide a critical driver function on IntClust-2 basic processes, such as viability, proliferation, and migration.

However, critical alterations in aberrant methylation and gene expression patterns have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we utilized guide positioning sequencing (GPS) to conduct whole-genome DNA methylation analysis in a unique human breast cancer progression model: MCF10 series of cell lines (representing benign/normal, atypical hyperplasia, and metastatic carcinoma). By integrating with mRNA-seq and matched clinical expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), six representative methylation-related differentially expressed genes (mrDEGs) were identified, including CAVIN2, ARL4D, DUSP1, TENT5B, P3H2, and MMP28. To validate our findings, we independently developed and optimized the dCas9-DNMT3L-DNMT3A system, achieving a high efficiency with a 98% increase in methylation at specific sites. DNA methylation levels significantly increased for the six genes, with CAVIN2 at 67.75 ± 1.05%, ARL4D at 53.29 ± 6.32%, DUSP1 at 57.63 ± 8.46%, TENT5B at 44.00 ± 5.09%, P3H2 at 58.50 ± 3.90%, and MMP28 at 49.60 ± 5.84%. RT-qPCR confirmed an inverse correlation between increased DNA methylation and gene expression. Most importantly, we mimicked tumor progression in vitro, demonstrating that transcriptional silencing of the TENT5B promotes cell proliferation in MCF10A cells owing to the crosstalk between hypermethylation and histone deacetylation. This study unveils the practical implications of DNA methylation dynamics of mrDEGs in reshaping epigenomic features during breast cancer malignant progression through integrated data analysis of the methylome and transcriptome. The application of the CRISPR/dCas9-based methylation editing technique elucidates the regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of individual genes within the DNA methylation signature, providing valuable insights for understanding breast cancer pathogenesis and facilitating potential therapeutic approaches in epigenome editing for patients with breast cancer.","Breast cancer progression, CRISPR/dCas9, DNA methylation, Epigenetic modification, Guide positioning sequencing"

An important parameter for the use of these molecules is the verification of the correct sgRNA oligonucleotide sequence. Apart from next-generation sequencing protocols, mass spectrometry (MS) has been proven as a powerful technique for this purpose. The protocol and investigations presented in this work show an optimal digestion and 100% sequence coverage of sgRNA, while top-down approaches or other ribonuclease (RNase) digestion strategies obtain a sequence coverage of up to 80-90% utilizing multiple RNases. The results in this publication were obtained by utilizing DNA-RNA hybrid GAPmer-like probes and RNase H, an enzyme which specifically hydrolyzes RNA in DNA-RNA double strands. We assessed the optimal length of the DNA segment of these hybrid probes to maximize the specificity of the RNase H digestion and to achieve complete sequence confirmation by tandem MS analysis of the resulting digestion products. Furthermore, we showed that the approach is applicable for the identification of common synthesis-related impurities, like truncations and elongations.

The FecB allele in sheep is a mutation in the BMPRIB gene, recognized as the first major gene responsible for the high fecundity trait in sheep, leading to an increased ovulation rate in ewe. In this study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous-directed repair (HDR) to introduce a defined point mutation (c.746 A > G) using single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) and the ligase IV inhibitor (SCR7) into the BMPRIB gene of fine wool sheep. A total of nine gene-edited sheep were produced, six of which carried the targeted point mutation, with a precise base substitution efficiency (A > G) of 31.6%. Based on the six targeted founders (F0), we expanded the BMPRIB-targeted population, which included F1 heterozygous (B+) and F2 homozygous(BB) or heterozygous offspring. The average litter size of F1 ewes carrying the B + allele reached 170%, comparable to that of heterozygous native Australian Booroola sheep. Gene-edited ewes with B + and BB genotype produced 0.62 and 0.42 more lambs, respectively, compared to wide-type ewes (p < 0.01). Our results also indicated that the parity signification, our data demonstrate that highly efficient introduction of the intended base mutation into the sheep genome can be achieved by combining the CRISPR/Cas9 system with ssODN and SCR7. The offspring of BMPR/B edited sheep with the defined mutation exhibited high fecundity performance.

However, genetic tools for the manipulation of their genes had not been developed until now. Here, we successfully implement CRISPR/Cas9 as a technique to modify the genome of the stick insect M. extradentata. As proof-of-concept we targeted two genes involved in the ommochrome pathway of eye pigmentation (cinnabar and white, second and first exon, respectively), to generate knockout (KO) mutants. Microinjections were performed within 24 h after oviposition, to focus on the mononuclear (and haploid) stage of development. The KOs generated resulted in distinct eye and cuticle colour phenotypes for cinnabar and white. Homozygous cinnabar mutants showed pale pigmentation of eyes and cuticle. They develop into adults capable of producing viable eggs. Homozygous white KO resulted in a completely unpigmented phenotype in developing embryos that were unable to hatch. In conclusion, we show that CRISPR/Cas9 can be successfully applied to the genome of M. extradentata by creating phenotypically different and viable insects. This powerful gene editing technique can now be employed to create stable genetically modified lines using a parthenogenetic non-model organism.","Medauroidea Extradentata, CRISPR/Cas9, Eye pigments, Neurogenetics, Parthenogenesis"

Among these insertions, retrotransposable elements (REs) and host genomic coding and regulatory sequences are prevalent. RE frequencies and 3D genome organization analysis suggest LgIns originate from randomly acquired genomic fragments by DNA repair mechanisms. Additionally, significant unintended full-length and concatemeric double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor integrations occur when donor DNA is present. We further demonstrate that phosphorylated dsDNA donors consistently reduce large insertions and deletions by almost two-fold without compromising homology-directed repair (HDR) efficiency.

The conjugations of small molecules such as (p-methylphenyl) glycine, pyrenebutyrate and cysteines are used for the same purpose. Molecular level interactions are governed mostly by ionic (cationic/anionic), covalent and noncovalent interactions with various molecular entities of glycocalyx matrix on plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Although the role of noncovalent interactions in cellular uptake is not fully understood, several recent advances have focused on the noncovalent interaction-based strategies of intracellular delivery of small molecules and proteins into mammalian cells.

To explore the mechanisms of lncRNA regulation of SVV infection and interferon responses. We performed complete transcriptome sequencing analysis of porcine kidney 15 (PK-15) after infection with SVV-1 strain and IFN-α treatment, and identified and screened the sequencing data to obtain potential functional lncRNA-ISL. selected genes were knocked down using CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNAs (gRNAs), and the results of the sequencing were monitored by qRT-PCR and protein blotting in multiple cell lines for selected gene mRNAs and their proteins as well as SVV infection. The results showed that 68 lncRNAs were significantly altered by IFN-α and 176 lncRNAs were significantly altered after SVV infection. We found that lncRNA-ISL gRNA significantly inhibited SVV infection compared to negative gRNA control. The expression of the antiviral ISG G1P3 was significantly increased following lncRNA-ISL gRNA editing compared to negative gRNA control in SVV-infected PK-15 cells. We observed that lncRNA-ISL regulation of SVV was independent of JAK-STAT signaling and not associated with G1P3 DNA methylation.

In this study, through bioinformatics analysis, we concluded that LARP3 expression is associated with a poor prognosis for patients with HCC. Through cellular experiments such as gene editing and phenotypic functions, we found that LARP3 promotes the occurrence and development of HCC and inhibits apoptosis. Finally, through biological means such as RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, western blotting, and the construction of a subcutaneous tumorigenesis model in nude mice, we concluded that inhibition of HCC apoptosis by LARP3 is related to LARP3 negatively regulating ROS level and inhibiting the PI3K/c-Fos/apoptosis axis.

Two Leydig cell populations produce these hormones but at different times during development: fetal Leydig cells, which are active during fetal life, and adult Leydig cells, which are functional postnatally. Historically, our ability to understand the origin and function of Leydig cells has been made difficult by the lack of genetic models to exclusively target these cells. Taking advantage of the Leydig cell-exclusive expression pattern of the Insl3 gene, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing strategy to knock-in iCre recombinase into the mouse Insl3 locus. To demonstrate the Leydig cell-exclusive nature of our iCre line, lineage-tracing experiments were performed by crossing Insl3iCre mice with a Rosa26LoxSTOPLox-TdTomato reporter. iCre activity was restricted to male offspring. TdTomato fluorescence was detected both in fetal and adult Leydig cells and colocalized with CYP17A1, a classic Leydig cell marker. Prior to birth, fluorescence was observed in fetal Leydig cells beginning at embryonic day 13.0. Fluorescence was also detected in adult Leydig cells starting at postnatal day 5 and continuing to the mature testis. Fluorescence was not detected in any other fetal or adult tissue examined, except for the unexpected finding that the adrenal cortex contains some Insl3-expressing Leydig-like cells. Our Leydig cell-exclusive iCre line therefore constitutes an invaluable new tool to study not only the origin of Leydig cells but also to target genes that have been long-proposed to be important for the development and functioning of these critical endocrine cells.","Cre recombinase, Leydig, adrenal, steroidogenic cells, transgenic mice"

Previously, we identified a key gene, Casein Kinase I (GhCKI), that negatively regulates male fertility in upland cotton under HT. However, conventional genetic manipulations of GhCKI would result in male sterility, hindering its utilization in breeding programs. Here, we engineered quantitative variation for anther thermotolerance-related traits in upland cotton by creating weak promoter alleles of GhCKI genes, using CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cpf1 genome editing. Then, we screened and identified two new upland cotton plant lines exhibiting a HT-tolerant phenotype with edited GhCKI promoters, and characterized their corresponding heat-tolerant allelic genotypes. Further research revealed that the primary reason for the HT tolerance of the GhCKI promoter editing mutants is that the trans-acting factors GhMYB73 and GhMYB4, which positively regulate GhCKI expression under HT, failed to bind and activate the expression of GhCKI. Overall, our study not only provides a rapid strategy to generate new beneficial alleles but also offers novel germplasm resources and molecular insights for crop HT tolerance breeding.","GhCKI, anther, high temperature, promoter editing, upland cotton"

These biomarkers, although not yet translated into clinically approved options, offer therapeutic targets as epigenetic modifications are reversible. Indeed, clinical trials are designed to inhibit epigenetic writers, erasers, or readers using epigenetic drugs to interfere with epigenetic dysregulation in brain disorders. However, since such drugs elicit genome-wide effects and potentially cause toxicity, the recent developments in the field of epigenetic editing are gaining widespread attention.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are three multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that are partially explained by genetics (gene mutations and genetic risk factors) and influenced by non-genetic factors (i.e., aging, lifestyle, and environmental conditions). Examining comprehensive studies of global and locus-specific (epi)genomic and transcriptomic alterations in human and mouse brain samples at the cell-type resolution has uncovered important phenomena associated with AD. First, DNA methylation and histone marks at promoters contribute to transcriptional dysregulation of genes that are directly implicated in AD pathogenesis (i.e., APP), neuroplasticity and cognition (i.e., PSD95), and microglial activation (i.e., TREM2). Second, the presence of AD genetic risk variants in cell-type-specific distal enhancers (i.e., BIN1 in microglia) alters transcription, presumably by disrupting associated enhancer-promoter interactions and chromatin looping. Third, epigenomic erosion is associated with widespread transcriptional disruption and cell identity loss. And fourth, aging, high cholesterol, air pollution, and pesticides have emerged as potential drivers of AD by inducing locus-specific and global epigenetic modifications that impact key AD-related pathways. Epigenetic studies in ALS/FTD also provide evidence that genetic and non-genetic factors alter gene expression profiles in neurons and astrocytes through aberrant epigenetic mechanisms.

The present study employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to create the gols4 mutant in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), which exhibits a semi-dwarf phenotype. Results showed that glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, galactinol, and raffinose levels were significantly reduced in the slgols4 mutant, impairing material transport and affecting the balance of soluble carbohydrates. Integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data indicated not only a decrease in the expression of synthesis genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis but also a significant reduction in the content of lignin and flavonoids, which are byproducts of phenylpropanoid metabolism.

This review aims to shed light on the use of neoteric genomics and genome editing tools in understanding the genetics and molecular regulation of male sterility in tomato. Plant male gametophyte development is highly susceptible to environmental stress. Abnormalities at any stage of male reproductive development, such as premature or delayed tapetal cell degradation triggered by oxidative stress and programmed cell death (PCD) leads to male sterility in tomato.

Recently, the role of open reading frames (ORFs) in governing cytoplasmic male sterility in tomato has also been documented. This review highlights the genetic and genomic progress in the investigation of underlying molecular pathways and practical application of potential male sterile mutants in tomato breeding. The applications and future prospects of genome engineering with CRISPR/Cas9 and mitoTALEN in the generation of novel male sterile systems to expedite tomato breeding is discussed.","CRISPR/Cas9, Genomics, Hybrid breeding, Male sterility, Plant reproduction, Tomato"

In this article, I provide evidence for this proposition across five pre-registered hypotheses about the divisive attributes of moralized attitudes in the context of science and technology. Using public opinion data in the United States on three issues-combating climate change, developing gene editing therapies for humans, and labeling genetically modified food-this study demonstrates that moralized attitudes have the potential to exacerbate resistance to scientific evidence and hostility between those with opposing positions. These findings provide strong proof of concept that studying variation in the degree to which individuals moralize issues is an important future direction for understanding persistent public divides over science and technology.","climate change, genetic modification, moral conviction, moralization, polarization"

To explore the phylogenetic relationships and organelle evolution mechanisms of Daphniphyllaceae species, we sequenced and assembled the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of Daphniphyllum macropodum. We also conducted comparative analyses of organelles in Daphniphyllaceae species in terms of genome structure, phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, RNA editing events, and evolutionary rates, etc. Results indicated differences in the evolutionary patterns of the plastome and mitogenome in D. macropodum. The plastome had a more conserved structure but a faster nucleotide substitution rate, and the mitogenome showed a more complex structure while the mitotic genome shows a more complex structure but a slower nucleotide substitution rate. We identified several unidirectional protein-coding gene transfer events from the plastome to the mitogenome based on homology analysis, but no transfer events occurred from the mitogenome to the plastome. Multiple TE fragments existed in organelle genomes, and two organelles showed different preferences for nuclear TE insertion types. The estimation of divergence time indicated that the differentiation of Daphniphyllaceae and Altingiaceae at around 29.86 Mya might be due to the dramatic uplift of Tibetan Plateau during the Oligocene. About 75% of codon changes in organelles were found to be hydrophilic to hydrophobic amino acids. The RNA editing in protein-coding transcripts is the result of amino acid changes to increase their hydrophobicity and conservation in alleles, which may contribute to the formation of functional 3D structures in proteins.

However, macrophages are difficult to transfect because of nucleic acid sensors that can trigger the degradation of foreign plasmid DNA. Here, we developed a macrophage-specific editing (MAGE) system by which compact plasmid DNA encoding a CasRx editor can be delivered to macrophages by a poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) carrier to bypass the DNA sensor and enable RNA editing in vitro and in vivo. We identified a four-arm branched PBAE with 1-(2-aminoethyl)-4-methylpiperazine end-capping (PBAE29) that enables highly efficient macrophage transfection. PBAE29-mediated transfection of cultured macrophages stimulated less inflammatory cytokine production and inflammasome activation compared with traditional lipofectamine or electroporation-mediated plasmid delivery. Transfection efficiency was further improved by delivering CasRx by minicircle plasmid. The MAGE system incorporated a layer of carboxylated-mannan coating to target macrophage mannose receptors and a macrophage-specific promoter for enhanced selectivity. The delivery of CasRx with guide RNA targeting the transcripts for sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin similar to lectin 10 and signal regulatory protein alpha expression resulted in effective protein knockdown, improving macrophage phagocytosis. The MAGE system also showed efficacy in targeting macrophages in vivo, stimulating antitumor immune responses and reducing tumor volume in murine tumor models, including patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts in humanized mice. In sum, the MAGE system presents a promising platform for in vivo macrophage-specific delivery of RNA editing tools that can be applied as a cancer therapy.",N/A

Crantz (camelina) is a Brassicaceae oilseed with a rapidly growing reputation for the deployment of advanced lipid biotechnology and metabolic engineering. Camelina is recognized by agronomists for its traits, including yield, oil/protein content, drought tolerance, limited input requirements, plasticity, and resilience. Its utility as a platform for metabolic engineering was then quickly recognized, and biotechnologists have benefited from its short life cycle and facile genetic transformation, producing numerous transgenic interventions to modify seed lipid content and generate novel products. The desire to work with a plant that is both a model and crop has driven the expansion of research resources for camelina, including increased availability of genome and other -omics data sets. Collectively, the expansion of these resources has established camelina as an ideal plant to study the regulation of lipid metabolism and genetic improvement. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of camelina enables the design-build-test-learn cycle to be transitioned from the controlled environment to the field. Complex metabolic engineering to synthesize and accumulate high levels of novel fatty acids and modified oils in seeds can be deployed, tested, and undergo rounds of iteration in agronomically relevant environments. Engineered camelina oils are now increasingly being developed and used to sustainably supply improved nutrition, feed, biofuels, and fossil fuel replacements for high-value chemical products. In this review, we provide a summary of seed fatty acid synthesis and oil assembly in camelina, highlighting how discovery research in camelina supports the advance of metabolic engineering toward the predictive manipulation of metabolism to produce desirable bio-based products. Further examples of innovation in camelina seed lipid engineering and crop improvement are then provided, describing how technologies (e.g. genetic modification [GM], gene editing [GE], RNAi, alongside GM and GE stacking) can be applied to produce new products and denude undesirable traits. Focusing on the production of long chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in camelina, we describe how lipid biotechnology can transition from discovery to a commercial prototype. The prospects to produce structured triacylglycerol with fatty acids in specified stereospecific positions are also discussed, alongside the future outlook for the agronomic uptake of camelina lipid biotechnology.",N/A

We observe a significantly higher formation frequency of deletions and inversions with DSBs in proximity compared with deletions and inversions with DSBs not in proximity in K562 cells. Additionally, our results suggest that DSB proximity may affect the ligation of chimeric deletion junctions. Taken together, spatial proximity between DSBs is a significant predictor of large-scale deletion and inversion frequency induced by CRISPR-Cas9 in K562 cells. This finding has implications for understanding SVs in the human genome and for the future application of CRISPR-Cas9 in gene editing and the modeling of rare SVs.",N/A

Subretinal administration of adenine base editor and double strand break-inducing Cas9 nuclease eRNPs mediate genome editing in both species. Editing occurs in retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells, with favorable tolerability in both species. Using transgenic reporter strains, we determine that editing primarily occurs close to the site of administration, within the bleb region associated with subretinal injection. Our results show that subretinal administration of eRNPs in mice mediates base editing of up to 12% of the total neural retina, with an average rate of 7% observed at the highest dose tested. In contrast, a substantially lower editing efficiency was observed in minipigs; even with direct quantification of only the treated region, a maximum base editing rate of 1.5%, with an average rate of <1%, was observed.

These complex networks have been shown to be disrupted during aging, disease, and cancer. However, profiling these networks across diverse cell types and states has been limited due to the technical constraints of existing methods for mapping DNA:Protein interactions in single cells. As a result, a critical gap remains in understanding where TFs or other chromatin remodelers bind to DNA and how these interactions are perturbed in pathological contexts. To address this challenge, we developed a transformative single-cell immuno-tethering DNA:Protein mapping technology. By coupling a species-specific antibody-binding nanobody to a cytosine base editing enzyme, this approach enables profiling of even weak or transient factor binding to DNA, a task that was previously unachievable in single cells. Thus, our Docking & Deamination followed by sequencing (D&D-seq) technique induces cytosine-to-uracil edits in genomic regions bound by the target protein, offering a novel means to capture DNA:Protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. Importantly, this technique can be seamlessly incorporated into common single-cell multiomics workflows, enabling multimodal analysis of gene regulation in single cells. We tested the ability of D&D-seq to record TF binding both in bulk and at the single-cell level by profiling CTCF and GATA family members, obtaining high specificity and efficiency, with clear identification of TF footprint and signal retention in the targeted cell subpopulations. Furthermore, the deamination reaction showed minimal off-target activity, with high concordance to bulk ChIP-seq reference data.

However, an optimal gene-editing enzyme for immune cell editing remains unidentified. In this study, we identified a novel gene editing enzyme, termed CRISPR/PcoCas12a, derived from Prevotella copri, which recognizes a 5'-YYN PAM sequence. We demonstrated that CRISPR/PcoCas12a offers a broader range of editing sites and superior editing efficiency at specific loci compared to AsCas12a. Furthermore, we illustrated its capability to enhance tumor suppression by targeting DGKα in TCR-T cells. DGKα functions as a negative regulator of T cell function, and its knockout significantly boosts the antitumor efficacy of TCR-T cells. The knockout efficiency and tumor suppressor ability of PcoCas12a targeting DGKα were markedly higher than those achieved with AsCas12a. Single-cell sequencing data confirmed that PcoCas12a-mediated DGKα gene knockout improves the tumor suppressive capabilities of T cells by promoting T-cell activation and strengthening immune regulatory responses.

Previous studies suggest that Cd in the bloodstream affects vascular endothelial cells (ECs), potentially contributing to vascular-related diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms of effects of Cd on ECs remain poorly understood. Notch signaling pathway abnormalities have been implicated in ECs disruption. The present study aims to investigate the effect of low Cd concentrations on the Notch signaling pathway in ECs. Mice were treated with low concentration of Cd (2.28 mg/kg), and tissues were collected for examination of mRNA and protein levels of Notch pathway components and VE-cadherin, a major junctional protein in ECs. We found that Cd treatment increases expression of NICD1, Hes1, Hey1, Hey2 and decreases expression of VE-cadherin in brain and kidney tissues. In vitro, a low concentration of Cd (1 μM) also induces increase expression of NICD1, Hes1, Hey1, Hey2, and decrease expression of VE-cadherin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Low concentration of Cd increased the permeability of HUVECs. We also found that Notch signaling negatively regulates the expression of VE-cadherin. In addition, DAPT, a Notch pathway inhibitor, prevents Cd-induced reduction in VE-cadherin expression in HUVECs. In summary, these findings revealed that Cd exposure decreases VE-cadherin expression through activation of the Notch signaling pathway.","Notch signaling, VE‐cadherin, cadmium, endothelial cells"

However, MRPS23 expression associations are rarely reported in breast cancer (BC). In this study, we explored the MRPS23 expression in BC cells compared with the non-tumoral breast cells. Overexpression and knockdown analysis of MRPS23 were performed in BC cells. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by western blot and qRT-PCR analysis. The role of MRPS23 in the malignant biological behaviors of BC cells was investigated using in-vitro experiments. Our results demonstrate that MRPS23 was aberrantly overexpressed at both the transcript and protein levels in BC cells. Additional findings reveal that deficiency of MRPS23 is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation/viability and compromised cell migration/invasion in BC cells. Relative to the sh-Ctrl group, the expression levels of cadherin, SNAI 1, and TWIST 1 decreased in the MRPS23 knockdown BC cells. We further found a significant decrease in the expression levels of Cyclin D1, Axin 2, LEF1, NKD1, and Survivin in MRPS23 knockdown cells. In conclusion, we found an association between MRPS23 knockdown and the metastasis ability of BC cells. These findings reveal that MRPS23 significantly decreases the migration and invasion of BC, thus inhibiting BC progression. We confirmed for the first time that MRPS23 expression determines the metastasis features of BC.

This study focused on millimeter wave (MMW) irradiation to clarify the salt-stress tolerance mechanism in wheat. In the present study, wheat-root growth, which was suppressed to 77.6% of the control level under salt stress, was recovered to the control level by MMW irradiation. To reveal the salt-stress tolerance mechanism of MMW irradiation on wheat, a proteomic analysis was conducted. Proteins related to cell cycle, proliferation, and transport in biological processes, as well as proteins related to the nucleus, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm within cellular components, were inversely correlated with the number of proteins. The results of the proteomic analysis were verified by immunoblot and other analyses. Among the proteins related to the scavenging reactive-oxygen species, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase accumulated under salt stress and further increased in the MMW-irradiated wheat. Among pathogen-related proteins, pathogenesis-related protein 1 and the Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitor decreased under salt stress and recovered to the control level in the MMW-irradiated wheat. The present results indicate that MMW irradiation of wheat seeds improves plant-growth recovery from salt stress through regulating the reactive oxygen species-scavenging system and the pathogen-related proteins. These genes may contribute to the development of salt-stress-tolerant wheat through marker-assisted breeding and genome editing.","millimeter-wave irradiation, proteomics, reactive oxygen species-scavenging system, salt stress, wheat"

One of the several existing approaches to treat DMD is gene therapy, based on alternative splicing and mutant exon skipping. Testing of such therapy requires animal models that carry mutations homologous to those found in human patients. Here, we report the generation of two genetically modified mouse lines, named ""insT"" and ""insG"", with distinct mutations at the same position in exon 51 that lead to a frameshift, presumably causing protein truncation. Hemizygous males of both lines exhibit classical signs of muscular dystrophy in all muscle tissues except for the cardiac tissue. However, pathological changes are more pronounced in one of the lines. Membrane localization of the protein is reduced to the point of absence in one of the lines. Moreover, an increase in full-length isoform mRNA was detected in diaphragms of insG line mice. Although further work is needed to qualify these mutations as sole origins of dissimilarity, both genetically modified mouse lines are suitable models of DMD and can be used to test gene therapy based on alternative splicing.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy, animal model, dystrophin, gene therapy"

We found that MSTN gene-edited cattle were superior to non-gene-edited cattle in terms of meat pH, shear force, and intramuscular fat content. However, no significant differences were observed in water-holding capacity, water content, and protein content of the meat. Metabolomics analysis revealed three upregulated differential metabolites common to MSTN gene-edited and non-gene-edited cattle across three breeds, namely lactoyl-valine, 3-phenylactic acid, and lactoyl-methionine. Some studies have indicated that these metabolites can improve the meat's flavor.

Previous studies reported that CRISPR/Cas12a is naturally inactivated in G. oxydans, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identified anti-CRISPR proteins AcrVA6, AcrVA7 and AcrVA8 in G. oxydans. They functioned as acetyltransferases to inactivate FnCas12a by respectively acetylating Lys671, Lys589 and Lys823 of FnCas12a. Lys671 and Lys823 were related residues that recognise the protospacer-adjacent motif, modification of AcrVA6 and AcrVA8 untangled the interaction between FnCas12a and dsDNA, while Lys589 played an important role in binding to the crRNA-target DNA heteroduplex, AcrVA7 prevented the formation of FnCas12a-crRNA binary complexes. In addition, histone deacetylase HDAC11 was found to prevent modification of FnCas12a by AcrVA6. Quantum mechanical calculations showed that ser37 of AcrVA6, as an intermediate between acetyl group and receptor protein, achieves acetylation through ping-pong transfer mechanism. Finally, the acetyltransferase AcrVA6 and the deacetylase HDAC11 served as photoswitches by writing and erasing acetyl groups, respectively, to achieve continuous on-off of FnCas12a. Our study reveals different mechanisms by which acetyltransferase inactivates Cas12a and successfully applies reversible acetylation to the regulation of gene editing tools, providing new insights into the function and application of acetylation.","Acetylation mechanism, Acetyltransferase, Anti-CRISPR protein, Photoswitches, Transcription-translation"

Enveloped delivery vehicles (EDVs) are engineered virally derived particles capable of packaging and delivering CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). However, the presence of lentiviral genome encapsulation and replication proteins in EDVs has obscured the underlying delivery mechanism and precluded particle optimization. Here, we show that Cas9 RNP nuclear delivery is independent of the native lentiviral capsid structure. Instead, EDV-mediated genome editing activity corresponds directly to the number of nuclear localization sequences on the Cas9 enzyme. EDV structural analysis using cryo-electron tomography and small molecule inhibitors guided the removal of ~80% of viral residues, creating a minimal EDV (miniEDV) that retains full RNP delivery capability. MiniEDVs are 25% smaller yet package equivalent amounts of Cas9 RNPs relative to the original EDVs and demonstrated increased editing in cell lines and therapeutically relevant primary human T cells.

Pathogenic variants in human BLM cause the autosomal recessive disorder Bloom Syndrome, characterized by predisposition to numerous types of cancer. Prior studies of Drosophila Blm mutants lacking helicase activity or protein have shown sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, defects in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), female sterility, and improper segregation of chromosomes in meiosis. Blm orthologs have a well conserved and highly structured RecQ helicase domain, but more than half of the protein, particularly in the N-terminus, is predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Because this region is poorly conserved across metazoa, we compared closely related species to identify regions of conservation that might be associated with important functions. We deleted two Drosophila-conserved regions in D. melanogaster using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and assessed the effects on several Blm functions. Each deletion had distinct effects. Deletion of either conserved region 1 (CR1) or conserved region 2 (CR2) compromised DSB repair through synthesis-dependent strand annealing and resulted in increased mitotic crossovers. In contrast, CR2 is critical for embryonic development but CR1 is less important. Loss of CR1 leads to defects in meiotic crossover designation and patterning but does not impact meiotic chromosome segregation, whereas deletion of CR2 does not result in significant meiotic defects. Thus, while the two regions have overlapping functions, there are distinct roles facilitated by each. These results provide novel insights into functions of the N-terminal region of Blm helicase.","Bloom syndrome helicaseq, DNA repair, intrinsically disordered region, recombination"

Although previous research has often focused on increasing the soybean isoflavone content because of the estrogen-like activity of dietary soy in humans, the rapidly increasing demand for soybean as a plant-based meat substitute has raised concerns about excessive isoflavone intake. Therefore, the production of isoflavone-free soybean has been anticipated. However, there have been no reports of an isoflavone-free soybean until now. Here, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (IFS), which is essential for isoflavone biosynthesis, was targeted for genome editing in soybean. A novel CRISPR/Cas9 system using Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 instead of the commonly-used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 was established and customized. Through Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation, IFS-edited hairy roots were generated in which all three IFS genes contained deletion mutations. Metabolome analyses of IFS-edited hairy roots revealed that isoflavone content significantly decreased, whereas levels of flavonoids, including a novel chalcone derivative, increased. A transcriptome analysis revealed changes in the expression levels of a large number of genes, including jasmonic acid-inducible genes. In addition, the functions of selected transcription factor genes (MYB14-L, GmbHLH112, and GmbHLH113), which were dramatically upregulated by IFS editing, were investigated by multi-omics analyses of their over-expressing hairy root lines. They appear to be involved in flavonoid and triterpene saponin biosynthesis, salicylic acid metabolism, and central carbon metabolism. Overall, the results indicated that editing IFS genes caused the redirection of the metabolic flux from isoflavonoid biosynthesis to flavonoid accumulation, as well as dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks.","CRISPR/Cas9, IFS, SaCas9, hairy root, isoflavone, omics analysis"

Misregulation of gene expression can have substantial, negative consequences that result in disease or tissue dysfunction that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Several strategies to inhibit gene expression at the level of mRNA transcription and translation have been developed, such as anti-sense inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. However, these strategies have some limitations in terms of specificity, toxicity, and ease of use. We have designed a nanomaterials-based tool to inhibit gene expression in eukaryotic cells with a potential application in basic and biomedical research. At the heart of our rational design approach is a polymer dots (Pdots)-based nanoplatform that can provide a means to deliver gene-specific small interfering (siRNA) into cells while at the same time providing a visualization mechanism to determine which cells have taken up the siRNA. The Pdots that we designed and synthesized had an average size 64.25 ± 0.60 nm and a zeta potential that was +37.40 ± 8.28 mV. The Pdot-1 nmole Gapdh siRNA showed an average size of 82.27 ± 9.83 nm, with the zeta potential values determined to be -52.00 ± 6.05 mV in the HEPES buffer. Both Pdots and Pdot-siRNA displayed two emission peaks in the visible (588 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) emission range (775 nm).

Large-animal models are particularly valuable for assessing locoregional therapies, which are widely employed across HCC stages. This study aimed to develop a large-animal HCC model with tailored tumor mutations. The Oncopig, a genetically engineered pig with inducible TP53R167H and KRASG12D, was used in the study. Hepatocytes were isolated from Oncopigs and exposed to Cre recombinase in vitro to create HCC cells, and additional mutations were introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of PTEN and CDKN2A. These edits increased Oncopig HCC cell proliferation and migration. Autologous HCC cells with these CRISPR edits were implanted into Oncopigs using two approaches: ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver injections, which resulted in the development of localized intrahepatic masses, and portal vein injections, which led to multifocal tumors that regressed over time. Tumors developed by both approaches harbored PTEN and CDKN2A knockout mutations. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing genetically tailored HCC tumors in Oncopigs using somatic cell CRISPR editing and autologous implantation, providing a valuable large-animal model for in vivo therapeutic assessment.","CRISPR gene editing, HCC model, Large-animal model, Porcine model, Precision models"

Our study aimed to determine the functions of SlHP2 and SlHP3, two members of cytokinin signaling in tomato, in drought stress response using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. Ten distinct genome-edited lines were generated via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer and confirmed through Sanger sequencing. Stress experiments were conducted with two of these lines (slhp2,3-10 and slhp2,3-11), which harbored homozygous mutations in both genes. The responses of two lines carrying homozygous mutations in both genes under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced stress were examined using morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular methods. The genome-edited lines demonstrated enhanced water retention, reduced stomatal density, and less oxidative damage compared to the wild-type plants under PEG-induced stress. Moreover, the slhp2,3 double mutant plants exhibited improved root growth, showcasing their superior drought tolerance over wild-type plants by accessing deeper water sources and maintaining hydration in water-limited environments.

However, the editing or cleavage specificity of CRISPR Cas9 remains a major concern due to the off-target effects. The existing approaches to control or modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage include engineering Cas9 protein and development of anti-CRISPR proteins. There are also attempts on direct modification of sgRNA, for example, structural modification via truncation or hairpin design, or chemical modification on sgRNA such as partially replacing RNA with DNA. The above-mentioned strategies rely on extensive protein engineering and direct chemical or structural modification of sgRNA. In this study, we proposed an indirect method to modulate CRISPR Cas9 cleavage without modification on Cas9 protein or sgRNA. An oligonucleotide was used to form an RNA-DNA hybrid structure with the sgRNA spacer, creating steric hindrance during the Cas9 mediated DNA cleavage process. We first introduced a simple and robust method to assemble the oligo-ribonucleoprotein (oligo-RNP). Next, the cleavage efficiency of the assembled oligo-RNP was examined using different oligo lengths in vitro.

The cyclin-CDK system is highly conserved among eukaryotes, and CDK1 is considered essential for progression through the M phase. However, the extent to which cell cycle progression depends on CDK1 varies between cell types. Therefore, a range of cell types must be analyzed to comprehensively elucidate the role of CDK1. Cdk1-knockout mice exhibit lethality at an early developmental stage, specifically before the differentiation of various cell types. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of CDK1 deficiency in amphibian newts. Cdk1 was disrupted by injecting fertilized newt eggs with CRISPR/Cas9, and the resulting effects on embryonic development and cell proliferation were then evaluated. In both wild-type and Cdk1-crispant newt embryos, CDK1 protein was either stored in the egg until late embryogenesis or potentially derived from maternal mRNA, which may also be stored during this period. The embryos survived to the hatching stage, during which the cells responsible for forming the basic organs differentiated. To further characterize the long-term effects of Cdk1 knockout, parabiosis experiments were conducted using wild-type embryos and Cdk1 crispants. The results suggested that an endocycle occurred in the crispant larvae, as evidenced by increases in the size of several types of cells. It is anticipated that studies using newts will provide further insights into the role of Cdk1 in regulating the cell cycle.","Iberian ribbed newt, cell cycle, endocycle, parabiosis"

Enzyme specificity was characterized by In vivo 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family (2OGD) activity assays. We identified a 2OGD multi-gene cluster involved in coumarin/FC/pyranocoumarin biosynthesis; Species lacking FCs in leaves/fruit were homozygous for a 655-base solo-LTR frame-disrupting insertion within one dual specificity C2'H/F6'H encoding 2OGD gene, demonstrating that integrity of this gene is fully correlated with the capacity to biosynthesize metabolites of the extended FC pathway in leaves/fruit. A second 2OGD is the prominent gene expressed in citrus roots, which contain a unique pattern of extended FC pathway metabolites, including the predominant pyranocoumarins. A third 2OGD gene encodes a single activity F6'H, which appears to be induced at the transcript level by citrus pathogens.

There are distinct advantages with both systems. The T7 transient protocol is excellent for high throughput gene deletions and has been used to successfully delete hundreds of Leishmania genes to study mutant phenotypes and several research labs are now using this protocol to target all the genes in L. mexicana genome. The rRNA-P stable protocol stably expresses the plasmid derived gRNA and has been used to delete or disrupt single and multicopy Leishmania genes, perform single nucleotide changes and provide evidence for gene essentiality by directly observing null mutant promastigotes dying in culture. In this study, the rRNA-P stable protocol was used to target 22 Leishmania genes in which null mutants were not generated using the T7 transient protocol.

Emerging evidence highlights the significant role of glial cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, in the pathophysiology of ASD. Glial cells are crucial for maintaining homeostasis, modulating synaptic function, and responding to neural injury. Dysregulation of glial cell functions, including altered cytokine production, impaired synaptic pruning, and disrupted neuroinflammatory responses, has been implicated in ASD. Molecular mechanisms underlying these disruptions involve aberrant signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway, and epigenetic modifications, leading to altered gene expression profiles in glial cells. Moreover, microglial activation and reactive astrocytosis contribute to an inflammatory environment that exacerbates neural circuit abnormalities. Understanding these molecular mechanisms opens avenues for therapeutic interventions. Current therapeutic approaches targeting glial cell dysfunction include anti-inflammatory agents, modulators of synaptic function, and cell-based therapies.

The mechanisms underlying the opposite activity patterns are not fully understood but likely involve the interplay between the circadian time-keeping system and various arousal- or sleep-promoting factors, e.g., light or melatonin. Although the circadian systems between the two chronotypes share considerable similarities, the phase relationships between the principal and subordinate oscillators are chronotype-specific. While light promotes arousal and wakefulness in diurnal species like us, it induces sleep in nocturnal ones. Similarly, melatonin, the hormone of darkness, is commonly used as a hypnotic in humans but is secreted in the active phase of nocturnal animals. Thus, the difference between the two chronotypes is more complex than a simple reversal, as the physiological and neurological processes in diurnal mammals during the day are not equivalent to that of nocturnal ones at night. Such chronotype differences could present a significant translational gap when applying research findings obtained from nocturnal rodents to diurnal humans. The potential advantages of diurnal models are being discussed in a few sleep-related conditions including familial natural short sleep (FNSS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS). Considering the difference in chronotype, a diurnal model will be more adequate for revealing the physiology and physiopathology pertaining to human health and disease, especially in conditions in which circadian rhythm disruption, altered photic response, or melatonin secretion is involved.

Researchers have successfully used chemical induction, physical damage, gene editing technology, etc., to induce reproductive system damage in zebrafish to study the biological processes related to its reproductive diseases. Therefore, in this review, the main models and related advantages of zebrafish in reproductive diseases are summarized, the pathological mechanisms of zebrafish as a reproductive disease model are clarified, and new perspectives and valuable insights are provided for the treatment of human reproductive diseases.

39763297,A-to-I-Edited miR-1304-3p Inhibits Glycolysis and Tumor Growth of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Inactivating Wnt5a/ROR2 Signaling.,Molecular carcinogenesis,2025,"Peng Chen, Hang Zhou, Xian Yang, Yuzhen Zheng, Yujie Chen, Peiyuan Wang, Hao He, Shuoyan Liu, Feng Wang","A-to-I RNA editing is a pervasive mechanism in the human genome that affects the regulation of gene expression and is closely associated with the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. This study elucidates the regulatory mechanism of A-to-I edited miR-1304-3p in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and RT-qPCR assays were employed to quantify protein and mRNA expression. Colony formation, Edu, wound healing, and Transwell assays were applied to determine miRNA function. Glycolysis was assessed using glucose uptake and lactate production assay. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the downstream targets of miRNA, and a xenograft assay demonstrated the efficacy of the miRNA. The A-to-I RNA editing level of miR-1304-3p was observed to increase in KYSE180 and KYSE140 ESCC cells following ADAR1 treatment. Following A-to-I editing, the function of miR-1304-3p in ESCC progression underwent a reversal, shifting from carcinogenic to inhibitory. Wild-type (WT) miR-1304-3p targets IRS1, whereas the edited version targets ROR2. The WT miR-1304-3p, but not the edited version, suppressed the expression and tumor-suppressive effect of IRS1 in ESCC. Conversely, ROR2, a specific downstream target of the edited miR-1304-3p, acted as a tumor promoter in ESCC. Furthermore, A-to-I editing of miR-1304-3p can inhibit glycolysis and inactivate the Wnt5a/ROR2 signaling pathway in ESCC. A-to-I RNA editing alters the function of miR-1304-3p in ESCC by changing its target gene. The edited miR-1304-3p hinders the development of ESCC by inhibiting glycolysis and inactivating the Wnt5a/ROR2 signaling pathway.","A‐to‐I RNA editing, IRS1, Wnt5a/ROR2 signaling, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glycolysis, miR‐1304‐3p"

Genome editing in conjunction with patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a promising cell therapy strategy, as it replaces dysfunctional proteins resulting from genetic mutations with normal proteins. However, the low expression level and short half-life of FVIII still remain significant limiting factors in the efficacy of these approaches in HA. Here, we constructed a functionally enhanced FVIII variant, F309S/E1984V-mutated B domain-deleted (BDD)-FVIII (FE-FVIII), with increased activity and stability. We inserted FE-FVIII with a human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1α) promoter into the AAVS1 locus of HA patient-derived iPSCs via CRISPR/Cas9 (D10A) nickase to ensure expression in any cell type. FE-FVIII was expressed not only in undifferentiated FE-FVIII-inserted (FE-KI) iPSCs but also in endothelial cells (ECs) differentiated from them in vitro. Compared with mice transplanted with wild-type BDD-FVIII-containing ECs, immunocompetent HA mice intravenously transplanted with FE-KI ECs presented a 2.12-fold increase in FVIII activity in the blood and an approximately 20% greater survival rate after hemorrhagic tail injury. For sustained efficacy, FE-KI ECs were subcutaneously transplanted into immunodeficient HA mice, resulting in amelioration of the hemophilia phenotype for more than 3 months. This strategy can improve FVIII function and may provide a universal therapeutic approach for treating HA.",N/A

Thus, more attention should be given to developing new cereal cultivars with improved tolerance to environmental stress. However, during the development of new stress-tolerant cereal cultivars, the balance between improved stress responses (which occur at the expense of growth) and plant yield needs to be maintained. Thus, the urgent need for developing new cereal germplasm with improved stress tolerance could be fulfilled using semi-dwarf cereal mutants defective in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis or signaling. BRs are steroid phytohormones that regulate various developmental and physiological processes throughout the plant life cycle. Mutants defective in BR biosynthesis or responses show reduced plant height (dwarfism or semi-dwarfism). Importantly, numerous reports indicate that genetic modification or biotechnological manipulation of BR biosynthesis or signaling genes in cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare), which are of crucial importance for global agriculture, may facilitate the development of cereal germplasm with improved stress tolerance. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the genetic manipulation of BR homeostasis in the above-mentioned cereal crops aimed at improving plant responses to various environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity, oxidative stress, thermal stress, and biotic stresses. We highlight target BR-related genes and the effects of genetic manipulation (gene editing, overexpression, silencing or miRNA-mediated regulation) on plant adaptability to various stresses and provide future perspectives.",N/A

To achieve better athletic performance, chemical substances were used. By the mid-20th century, it became gradually recognized that the illegal use of doping substances can seriously endangered athletes' health and compromised the fairness of sports competitions. Over the past 30 years, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has established corresponding rules and regulations to prohibit athletes from using doping substances or restrict the use of certain drugs, and isotope, chromatography, and mass spectrometry techniques were accredited to detect doping substances. With the development of gene editing technology, many genetic diseases have been effectively treated, but enabled by the same technology, doping has also the potential to pose a threat to sports in the form of gene doping. WADA has explicitly indicated gene doping in the Prohibited List as a prohibited method (M3) and approved qPCR detection. However, gene doping can easily evade detection, if the target genes' upstream regulatory elements are considered, the task became more challenging. Hi-C experiment driven 3D genome technology, through perspectives such as topologically associating domain (TAD) and chromatin loop, provides a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of gene regulation and expression, thereby better preventing the potential use of 3D genome level gene doping.

This was accomplished by interrupting IL6 signal transducer (IL6ST), the common beta-subunit receptor used by the IL6 family. One series of studies cultured in vitro-produced (IVP) embryos with SC144, a pharmacological IL6ST inhibitor. Providing the inhibitor at a concentration that partially diminished IL6ST signaling reduced development to the 16-cell and blastocyst stages and reduced inner cell mass (ICM) cell numbers. Inhibitor concentrations that completely blocked IL6ST signaling prevented blastocyst development. Another series of studies used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt IL6ST. Two electroporation approaches were used to introduce guide RNAs and Cas9 protein into one-cell IVP embryos. Editing efficiency was ≥82%. Targeting IL6ST did not affect cleavage but reduced development to the 16-cell and blastocyst stages. A reduction in ICM cell numbers was detected, and a disorganization of the ICM was observed in approximately one-half of the IL6ST-targeted blastocysts. These observations indicate that embryo-derived IL6 family members that signal through IL6ST are needed to support normal in vitro bovine embryo development. These signals are needed by the 16-cell stage and for ICM cell development at the blastocyst stage. There also is evidence that these signals support the overall cellular organization of the blastocyst.","In vitro embryo production, Blastocyst, Cattle, Crispr-cas9, Gene editing, Inner cell mass, Interleukin-6"

However, both ScCas9 and its evolved Sc++ variant still exhibit low genome editing efficiency in plants, particularly at the less preferred NTG and NCG PAM targets. In this study, a chimeric SpcRN++ variant is engineered by grafting the recognition (REC) domain of SpCas9 into the Sc++ variant, incorporating the R221K/N394K mutations, and retaining the positively charged loop of S. anginosus Cas9. The SpcRN++ variant exhibits a higher genome editing capacity and wider target range than the Sc++ variant in rice protoplasts and stable transgenic plants. Further evidence indicates that nSpcRN++-based A3A/Y130F and TadA8e exhibit enhanced cytosine and adenine editing efficiency in plants. Finally, herbicide-resistant rice germplasms are produced by targeting the OsACC gene using nSpcRN++-based adenine base editors.

Recent genomic studies have highlighted the role of rare variants in ASD. This study aimed to identify genes affected by rare variants shared by siblings with ASD and validate the function of a candidate gene FRRS1L. By integrating the whole genome sequencing data of 866 multiplex families from the Hartwell Foundation's Autism Research and Technology Initiative and Autism Speaks MSSNG project, we identified rare variants shared by two or more siblings with ASD. Using shared rare variants (SRVs), we selected candidate genes for ASD. Gene prioritization by evolutionary features and expression alterations on autism identified FRRS1L in two families, including one with impaired social behaviors. One variant in this family was 6 bp away from human-specific trinucleotide fixation. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9 experiments demonstrated downregulation by a family variant and upregulation by a fixed site. Population genetics further demonstrated that upregulation of this gene has been favored during human evolution. Various mouse behavioral tests showed that Frrs1l knockout specifically impairs social novelty recognition without altering other behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we constructed humanized mice by introducing human sequences into a mouse genome. These knockin mice showed improved abilities to retain social memory over time. The results of our population genetic and evolutionary analyses, behavior experiments, and genome editing propose a molecular mechanism that may confer a selective advantage through social memory enhancement and may cause autism-related social impairment when disrupted in humans.

Nonetheless, the sustainability of grain production is increasingly jeopardized by both biotic and abiotic stressors exacerbated by climate change, which increases the crop's rvulnerability to pests and diseases. Genome-editing by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated Protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) presents a potential solution for enhancing rice productivity and resilience under climatic stress. This technology can alter a plant's genetic components without the introduction of foreign DNA or genes. It has become one of the most extensively used approaches for discovering new gene functions and creating novel varieties that exhibit a higher tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses, herbicide resistance, and improved yield production. This study examines numerous CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-editing techniques for gene knockout, gene knock-in, multiplexing for simultaneous disruption of multiple genes, base-editing, and prime-editing. This review elucidates the application of genome-editing technologies to enhance rice production by directly targeting yield-related genes or indirectly modulating numerous abiotic and biotic stress-responsive genes. We highlight the need to integrate genetic advancements with conventional and advanced agricultural methods to create rice varieties that are resilient to stresses, thereby safeguarding food security and promoting agricultural sustainability amid climatic concerns.",N/A

Mutations in the DYSF gene cause a panoply of genetic muscular dystrophies. We targeted a frequent loss-of-function, DYSF exon 44, founder frameshift mutation with mRNA-mediated delivery of SpCas9 in combination with a mutation-specific sgRNA to primary muscle stem cells from two homozygous patients. We observed a consistent >60% exon 44 re-framing, rescuing a full-length and functional dysferlin protein. A new mouse model harboring a humanized Dysf exon 44 with the founder mutation, hEx44mut, recapitulates the patients' phenotype and an identical re-framing outcome in primary muscle stem cells. Finally, gene-edited murine primary muscle stem-cells are able to regenerate muscle and rescue dysferlin when transplanted back into hEx44mut hosts.

Precision genome editing has been proposed to eliminate such potentially harmful mutations; however, experimental demonstration is lacking. Here we identified a deleterious mutation in the tomato transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF SP2 (SSP2), which became prevalent in the domesticated germplasm and diminished DNA binding to genome-wide targets. We found that the action of SSP2 is partially redundant with that of its paralog SSP in regulating shoot and inflorescence architecture.

Self-sustaining genetic control strategies have shown great potential in laboratory settings, but hesitancy due to their invasive and persistent nature may delay their implementation. Here, instead, we describe a self-limiting strategy, designed to have geographically and temporally restricted effect, based on a Y chromosome-linked genome editor (YLE). The YLE comprises a CRISPR-Cas9 construct that is always inherited by males yet generates an autosomal dominant mutation that is transmitted to over 90% of the offspring and results in female-specific sterility. To our knowledge, our system represents a pioneering approach in the engineering of the Y chromosome to generate a genetic control strain for mosquitoes.

To comprehensively understand the Cas12e family, we identify and characterize six unreported Cas12e members that vary in their CRISPR-locus architectures, PAM preferences, and cleavage efficacies. Interestingly, among all variants, PlmCas12e exhibits the most robust trans-cleavage activity and the lowest salt sensitivity in cis-cleavage. Further structural comparisons reveal that the unique NTSB domain in PlmCas12e is beneficial to DNA unwinding at high salt concentrations, while some NTSB-lacking Cas12e proteins rely on positively charged loops for dsDNA unwinding.

Moreover, non-CSCs can spontaneously transform into CSCs in special tumor microenvironments, thereby leading to poor prognosis or even failed treatments. Therefore, reversing CSCs into normal tumor cells in a sustained-acting manner is a promising strategy. It has been reported that down-regulation of FBXO44 protein expression inhibits tumor cell stemness. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, a well-known precise gene editing tool, was adopted to permanently block FBXO44 within the genome upon its successful implementation. Given this, a core-shell nanoparticle (NP) consisting of amphiphilic polymer core and crosslinked-hyaluronic acid shell (nDOX-PL/pFBXO44 NPs) is developed in this work to concurrently deliver FBXO44-targeted CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (pFBXO44) and doxorubicin (DOX) for combinational CSC reprogramming and chemotherapy of TNBC, which exhibits tumor cell targeting, endosomal escape, and reduction responsiveness to release DOX and plasmids in the cytoplasma. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated downregulation of FBXO44 expression could convert CSC into normal tumor cells, and effectively inhibit tumor growth without obvious side effects in vivo after combining with chemotherapy.

In this study, we knocked out TLR3 and MDA5 genes using gene-editing protocol, and stably transferred the duck RIG-I transgene into TLR3/MDA5 double knockout (KO) chicken DF1 cells. We investigated the antiviral responses induced by duck RIG-I in chicken cells. Duck RIG-I induced the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and inflammatory cytokines such as interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), interferon β (IFNβ), Mx1, and protein kinase R1 (PKR1) after treatment with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) in TLR3/MDA5 double KO DF1 cells. Additionally, to examine the duck RIG-I signaling cascade, we knocked out mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), which encodes an antiviral signaling factor in innate immunity. Duck RIG-I in TLR3/MDA5/MAVS triple KO DF1 cells did not activate downstream expression of ISGs. Finally, to analyze the global signaling pathways of duck RIG-I in chicken cells, next-generation sequencing of total mRNAs with and without poly I:C treatment was conducted.

These modifications are strongly linked to the development of many cancers. One of the most prevalent forms of RNA modifications in humans is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, catalyzed by the enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). With advancements in RNA sequencing technologies, the role of A-to-I modification in cancer has garnered increasing attention. Research indicates that the levels and specific sites of A-to-I editing are significantly altered in many malignant tumors, correlating closely with tumor progression. This editing occurs in both coding and noncoding regions of RNA, influencing signaling pathways involved in cancer development. These modifications can either promote or suppress cancer progression through several mechanisms, including inducing non-synonymous amino acid mutations, altering the immunogenicity of dsRNAs, modulating mRNA interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs), and affecting the splicing of circular RNAs (circRNAs) as well as the function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). A comprehensive understanding of A-to-I RNA editing is crucial for advancing the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of human cancers.

STGD1 typically declares early in life and leads to severe visual handicap. Abca4 gene-deletion mouse models of STGD1 accumulate lipofuscin, a hallmark of the disease, but unlike the human disease show no or only moderate structural changes and no functional decline. The human macula is highly enriched in cones, and reasoning that the low cone percentage in mice retinas (< 3%) might compromise faithful modelling of human maculopathies, we performed sub-retinal injections of CRISPR/Cas9-abca4 Adeno-Associated Virus constructs into young Sand Rats (Psammomys obesus), a diurnal rodent containing > 30% cones. Compared to control injections of AAV-abca4-GFP, treated eyes exhibited extensive retinal degeneration by two months. Sanger sequencing of the CRISPR targeted sequence show a clear edition of Abca4 gene. Non-invasive fundus imaging showed widespread photoreceptor loss, confirmed by ocular coherence tomography. Functional recording by single flash and flicker electroretinography showed significant decline in photopic (cone) light responses. Post-mortem real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed significant decrease of cone-specific (MW cone opsin) but not rod-specific (rhodopsin) markers. Transmission electron microscopy showed large numbers of lipid inclusions in treated but not control retinal pigmented epithelium. Finally, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analysis of whole P. obesus eyes showed the presence of all-trans retinal-dimer, not detected in rod-rich rat eyes. In conclusion, Abca4 knockout in P. obesus results in a predominantly cone degeneration phenotype, more accurately reflecting the etiology of human STGD1, and should be valuable for characterizing pathogenic pathways and exploring treatment options.","Animal model, Cone photoreceptors, Electrophysiology, Gene editing, Retinal degeneration, Stargardt’s disease"

However, the effects of MLPH during fat accretion have not been studied yet. Therefore, the objectives of the current study are to measure the temporal expression of the MLPH gene during the adipocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the effect of MLPH loss on fat accretion and adipocyte sizes in vivo using MLPH knockout quail model. The current in vitro studies reveal that MLPH gene expression levels were considerably elevated during adipogenesis in avian cells [101-fold in DF-1, 28.5-fold in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) and 4-fold in quail embryonic fibroblasts (QEF), compared to the undifferentiated cells of each cell type, p < 0.05]. In addition, fractionated fat cells (FC) showed increased expression levels of MLPH (5.7-fold, p < 0.05) compared to stromal-vascular cells (SVC). Using the MLPH knockout quail, disruption of the MLPH gene resulted in significantly reduced body weight (BW) and subcutaneous fat (S. Fat) pad weights compared to the wild type (WT) (p < 0.05). Further analysis through sectioning and staining of the fat tissues revealed that the mutation in Rab binding domain (RBD) of quail MLPH resulted in decreased fat cell sizes (p < 0.01). Overall, our data clearly demonstrated that MLPH can be a potential adipogenic marker gene, and MLPH may be associated with fat accretion in the gene edited quail model, highlighting the important role of MLPH in adipogenesis.","Adipocyte Differentiation, Adipose hypotrophy, Genome Editing, Melanophilin, Quail"

Current management strategies primarily rely on aneurysm diameter and growth rates to predict rupture risk and determine the timing of surgical intervention. However, this approach has limitations, as ruptures can occur in smaller AAAs below surgical thresholds, and many large AAAs remain stable without intervention. This review highlights the need for more precise and individualized assessment tools that integrate biomechanical parameters such as wall stress, wall strength, and hemodynamic factors. Advancements in imaging modalities like ultrasound elastography, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), combined with artificial intelligence, offer enhanced capabilities to assess biomechanical indices and predict rupture risk more accurately. Incorporating these technologies can lead to personalized medicine approaches, improving decision-making regarding the timing of interventions. Additionally, emerging treatments focusing on targeted delivery of therapeutics to weakened areas of the aortic wall, such as nanoparticle-based drug delivery, stem cell therapy, and gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, show promise in strengthening the aortic wall and halting aneurysm progression.

CoS-MAGE improved over MAGE (multiplex automated genome engineering) by co-electroporation of an antibiotic resistance repair oligo along with the oligos for modification of the Escherichia coli chromosome. After several cycles of recombineering, the sub-population of mutants were selected among the antibiotic resistant colonies. However, a pre-generated strain with mutS deletion and multiple inactivated antibiotic resistance genes integration is required. Herein, CoS-MAGE was modified by employing a single copy BAC vector harboring a bla-mkan cassette and a Red helper vector cloned with dominant mutL E32K, thus bypassing the utilization of the pre-generated strain. The proof-of-concept of the new strategy, CoS-BAC-MAGE, was demonstrated via the mutation of non-essential genes, essential genes, and AT rich regions of the wild type strain E. coli MG1655. With this system, an editing efficiency of 60% was realized. Furthermore, by toggling between two antibiotic resistance genes (one active, the other defective) on the BAC, sequential mutations were achieved without the requirement of BAC vector elimination and re-transformation. Via CoS-BAC-MAGE, simultaneously mutations of three sites were obtained in a day.

The florigen-antiflorigen system universally controls flowering and plant architecture, and changes to the ratio of these components alter this transition and disrupt growth. The genes FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T), encoding the florigen protein FT, and CETS [CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)/TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1)/SELF-PRUNING (SP)], encoding antiflorigen proteins, have opposing roles. Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is one of the world's most widely cultivated cotton varieties, and its complex allotetraploid genome contains only one homoeologous pair of FT genes (GhFT-A and GhFT-D). The functionally conserved gene GhFT promotes flowering and plays a role in plant architecture, although the molecular regulation of flowering and plant architecture in cotton remains unclear. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to induce mutations in the first and second exons of GhFT, respectively. G. hirsutum cv. YZ-1 was transformed with a CRISPR/Cas9-GhFT vector using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a diverse set of mutations was identified at the editing site. Compared with the wild type, mutant plants could not transition between vegetative and reproductive growth, and significant alterations to plant architecture were observed. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed downregulation of the homologous floral meristem identity genes APETALA1 (GhAP1) and OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (GhSOC1) and upregulation of the TFL1 homologs GhTFL1-1 and GhTFL1-2. These results suggested that GhFT played a significant role in flowering time and plant architecture and that the ratio of florigen-antiflorigen components was critical to producing improved cotton varieties.

The capacity of the silkworm to secrete robust silk renders it a valuable economic resource, while its biological characteristics offer insights into a number of scientific disciplines. Despite the extensive research conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of silk secretion, many aspects remain unclear. In this study, a mutant strain was generated by editing the BmFib-L gene for silk fibroin, BmFib-L was observed to terminate prematurely at 27 amino acids, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The BmFib-L was entirely absent in the mutant strain in comparison to the wild type (WT). On the third day of the fifth instar, the posterior silk glands of the mutant strain were dissected and found to have no significant morphological differences compared to the WT. However, the mutant cocoon phenotypes exhibited significant changes. The findings demonstrated that BmFib-L plays a pivotal role in silk formation, yet is not indispensable for silk secretion. Furthermore, BmFib-L exerts a discernible influence on the mechanical properties of silk. A comparative analysis of the transcriptome of the mutant strain and the WT revealed that the elevated expression of transporter and metabolism-related genes in the mutant strain preserved the equilibrium of the silk gland cells, thereby guaranteeing the typical development of the mutant silk gland cells. These findings offer a novel perspective for investigating the mechanism of silk secretion in silkworms.","BmFib-L, Bombyx mori, CRISPR/Cas9, Fibroin light chain protein, Silk, Silkworm"

However, it is important to recognize that machinery-dependent diagnostic methods may only sometimes be available or practical in resource-limited settings, where direct implementation can be challenging. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-based diagnostics offer a promising alternative for nucleic acid detection. These methods provide gene sequence-specific targeting, multiplexing capability, rapid result disclosure, and ease of operation, making them suitable for point-of-care (POC) applications. CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid detection leverages the intrinsic gene-editing capabilities of CRISPR systems to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences with high precision, ensuring high specificity in identifying pathogens.

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and its isoforms are the host factors essential for infection by plant viruses in the genus Potyvirus. The present study describes the characterization of eIF4E gene in banana cultivar Nendran, and its interaction with the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) of banana bract mosaic virus (BBrMV). The in-silico analysis of 853 bp coding mRNA region of eIF4E revealed the presence of five exons. The deduced amino acid sequence had 99.58% identity with the predicted protein sequence of the eIF4E-1 in Musa acuminata subspecies malaccensis. Expression profiling of eIF4E gene in banana cultivar Nendran using qRT-PCR revealed up to 16.9-fold up-regulation of the gene in response to BBrMV infection, indicating its role in disease development. The three-dimensional models of the eIF4E and VPg proteins were generated to deduce the precise interaction between the two proteins. Using the online server ZDOCK, ten interaction complexes were obtained. In nine out of the ten complexes, the maximum number of residues of the eIF4E interacted with the Tyrosine-63rd residue of VPg.

Recent studies have reported the successful conversion of astrocytes into DANs by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to the rescue of motor symptoms in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD. However, follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte-to-DAN conversion model. Here, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of these TH-positive cells co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors. Nevertheless, our findings support a model where downregulation of neuronal, but not astrocytic, PTBP1 can mitigate symptoms in PD mice.","6-OHDA, CRISPR-cas, Ptbp1, base editing, gene therapy, mouse, neuroscience, parkinson's disease, regenerative medicine, stem cells"

In the last decade, several disease-modifying medications are in advanced stages of clinical development or have been approved to treat ATTR-CM. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate clinical trial data investigating the use of approved and investigational medications for the treatment of ATTR-CM. We performed a comprehensive literature search via PubMed and EMBASE to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating medications for the treatment of ATTR-CM published through August 2024. This narrative review describes the pathophysiology of ATTR-CM, highlights important screening and diagnostic work-up, and summarizes the existing clinical evidence resulting from our literature search.

Many mutations in the human β-cardiac myosin gene that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are thought to destabilize (decrease the population of) the IHM state. The effects of pathogenic mutations on the IHM structural state are often studied using indirect assays, including a single-ATP turnover assay that detects the super-relaxed (SRX) biochemical state of myosin functionally. Here we develop and use a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based sensor for direct quantification of the IHM state in solution. The FRET sensor was able to quantify destabilization of the IHM state in solution, induced by (a) increasing salt concentration, (b) altering proximal S2 tail length, or (c) introducing the HCM mutation P710R, as well as stabilization of the IHM state by introducing a dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutation (E525K).

We develop an antimicrobial strategy that applies the selective delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids to pathogens with biomimetic cationic hybrid vesicles (BCVs), irrelevant to bacterial drug resistance. CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids were constructed, replicating in MRAB or DRPA and expressing ribonucleic proteins, leading to irreparable chromosomal lesions; however, delivering the negatively charged plasmids with extremely large molecular weight to the pathogens at the infection site became a huge challenge.

The AP2/ethylene response factor (ERF) family is one of the largest plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) groups, playing key roles in plant growth and development. However, the role of ERF TFs in cotton's growth and development remains unclear. In this study, we identified GhERF109, a nuclear-localized ERF, which showed significant expression differences between ZM24 and pag1 cotton. Heterologous overexpression of GhERF109 in Arabidopsis resulted in reduced plant height, shortened root length, and reduced silique lengths compared to wild-type (WT) plants. In contrast, silencing GhERF109 in cotton led to a significant increase in plant height due to the elongation of stem cells. Overexpression of GhERF109 in cotton also produced a compact plant type with a notable reduction in height. RNA-seq analysis of GhERF109-silenced plants revealed 4123 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with many upregulated genes involved in auxin response, polar transport, cell expansion, cell cycle regulation, brassinolide (BL) biosynthesis, and very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) pathways.

The high heritability of KRN underscores its significance in maize breeding programs. In this review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation, differentiation, and regulation of KRN in maize. Specifically, we have discussed gene mapping studies, functional validation of KRN-associated genes, and the application of gene editing techniques to KRN in maize. We summarized the various methods used to map and fine-map QTLs controlling KRN and provide an overview of the current status of cloned KRN-regulating genes. Despite the identification of many genes associated with KRN, the complexity of its regulation-arising from multiple loci and intricate gene interactions-remains a challenge. Balancing KRN with kernel number per row (KNR) and kernel weight is critical for optimizing yield while ensuring stability across different environments. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of environmental factors on KRN, noting that despite its high heritability, environmental conditions can significantly affect this trait. Combining genotype-phenotype relationships with environmental data using big data and artificial intelligence could enhance maize breeding efficiency and accelerate genetic gains. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing traits, integrating environmental factors, and leveraging advanced technologies in maize breeding to achieve optimal yield and stress tolerance.
